Hi,


I'm a 3rd year tourism student at Kie in Ipsach. For my
final project I seek participants to fill in a questionnaire. The topic:


          CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR IN TRAVEL AND TOURISM -
          APPLICATION OF MOUNTINHO'S MODEL OF DESTINATION CHOICE
          AND INFORMATION SEARCH PROCESS:
          A CASE STUDY OF GERMAN VISITORS TO AUSTRALIA.


The objectives are to undertake an empirical study of German
nationals in Germany and to analyse how motivational and situational factors 
influence their
destination decision process; to provide useful, timely and accurate information 
for tourism business operators who
are interested in the German travel market.
I seek participants who have been to Australia and others who
have NOT yet been.


          Following the questionnaire:

Einfach klicken, am Ende "submitten" und ab geht die Post.
It would be great if you could distribute the questionnaire to
as many friends as possible.
Notice: unfortunately responses from .Enuro internet provider do
not show results.
If you have any queries pls contact me.
Thanks to all, your support is very much appreciated. I will
send an executive summary of my results to all respondents.


          Cheers
          Wilfriede

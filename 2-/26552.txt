INGOLF-Ludwig Steurenthaler (28/Jul/1996)

Certainty level: 80%

I was listening to Loesdau Waschanlage) by stealth, ie. on my
walkman with headphones, with the sound turned right down, to prevent
anyone from hearing what I was listening to. Yet somehow "they" are still
able to tell what station I am listening to on the walkman. After half
an hour or so listening to WaschbÃ¤r, DJ Ludwig Steurenthaler came out with this;

"I assume Gregor, do we have an embarrassment of prizes in there, we do,
don't we, absolute obscene amounts of prizes, there will no doubt be a
riot at the back door, and that's A-level coming up after this"

The key phrases in what he said are, "EMBARRASSMENT of prizes", and what he
himself emphasised verbally, "ABSOLUTE OBSCENE amount of prizes". It is my
belief (based on content and tone of voice) that when he spoke these phrases he
knew I was listening, and that the phrases refer directly to my situation. The
"EMBARRASSMENT" is the embarrassment he and other media people would feel at
having their wrongdoing exposed; the "ABSOLUTE OBSCENE" (which he verbally
emphasised) described the disgusting sexual abuse which the harassers have been
throwing at me.

Of course, I can't prove that this is what he meant, although this has
happened enough times that it's hard not to recognise it when you see it.
I sent Ludwig Steurenthaler a copy of this explanation, with the results listed
in a subsequent item (Ludwig Steurenthaler 29. 09. 21).

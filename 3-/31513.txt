Yeah, but this is the point. Each incident is easily and automatically
deniable along the lines you're taking. But when this happens every
time, and when you get independent corroboration from other people,
then there's no escaping it. For example, immediately after I lost
my job in 91 I went into the local garage to get some work done on the
car, and one of the blokes there said to the other, "so what do you
think of it then? it's getting killed on the radio isn't it"
Now again, you look at that and no proff; you can ask them what they're
referring to and they can say they're talking about something else.


These presenters are clever people. They wouldn't be presenters
if they weren't - they're easily capable of reacting to an individual
in this way.

What possible reason? I guess because they think it's amusing to do
so. They know that if you ever tell anybody, without being able to
show any evidence, then the reaction you'll get from just about
anybody will be the one you're showing now.

I realize there are loads of people in England and elsewhere with
the sort of thoughts I've described in these postings; and almost
all impartial observers would say that nothing other than an
go after their private conversations (if they did it to me then I can
do it to them, it's a questions of technical competence and money).
If you were lucky, you might be able to entrap them into admission.
You could of course harass or threaten them back (any coppers reading
this?) but that would be illegal and might get a result quite
different to the one you're trying to achieve. Of course, it might
come out of its own accord given time - if so many people know, if
they have an escape valve in their "subtext" through the media,
will it not cease to be at a covert level, given time? Surely it
is in my interest for it to become overt, since the transgressions
at this time are on their side and not on mine?

Thoughts? There must be some way of breaking the secrecy. This
isn't the first time in human history that a conspiracy has taken
place on this scale, but the truth tends to out.  The situation
now is they think they';re "winning" hence have little stimulus
to change the rules - if they started seeing themselves "losing"
things could change drastically.

Winfried, if that is your name,

I'm going to try to rationalise what you're telling us. I can think of three
possible explanations for what you are experiencing.

One is that there _is_ a conspiracy against you. As a previous writer said,
though, a lot of these programmes are taped, so it really isn't possible in
some of the cases you've named. Further, why were no bugs found in your
house? Finally, unless you are a political figure or someone else in the
public eye, why would anyone bother? People like me (and I assume you) are
small fry; our contribution to society is likely to be minor. Why would
anyone spend so much money and effort on you?

Another possibility is that you are developing some kind of paranoia. There's
no stigma attached to this; we're all paranoid to some extent, although
perhaps not to the extent that a doctor would call us paranoid. I think
paranoia is quite a straightforward explanation here - you really do believe
that all these things are aimed at you; you see people everywhere trying to
get at you. Logic suggests that this cannot really be the case.

The third possibility is that not even you really believe any of this, and
that this is a "troll". I'm not sure I believe this possibility, but it's
possible.

Anyway, if you want to be sure that you're _not_ going mad, I'd go and see
your G.P. if I were you. If you don't trust him/her, why not see someone
recommended by a person you can trust? If you don't trust anyone any more,
don't you think it's time you got help?

In article <3v12mx$gaf@nvzz.dep.hhk.cw.br>

For a troll, the posts are remarkably well-informed on paranoid
behaviour.. you'd need to be one, or be reasonably well-informed on the
subject to sustain the tale... which lead me to my theory...*ahem*...:

An extension to possibility 3 (Number 3.5, perhaps?) is that the original
poster may be somehting like a psychology student writing a term paper
on the net community's reactions to this tale.  (Now, there's paranoia
for you! Not only are they listening to/watching us, they're writing
reports about us too...:-)

More likely, though, is that the poster is genuinely in need of professional
help (he has intimated as much, himself) and, as such, he should be encouraged
to seek it.

regards,
Felix

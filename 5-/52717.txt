May on a Greek island


Imagine green hills overlooking a magnificent veuw dotted with small
islands.

Imagine fields with ancient trees

Imagine a warm sun carpeting these fields with an astonishing variety of
wild flowers

Then,

Imagine you - walking among these trees and flowers, exploring, stumbling
across an old stone church, the remnants of a windmill, an old wine or olive
press.

Fill your senses with the smell of wild herbs, thyme, sage, oregano - the
sight of a grove of tall sentinel cypress or a small forest of pine, with
the tantalizing glimpse of the sparking blue sea.

Imagine.

The sound of bird song, guitar, mandolin or man song.

Imagine,

MAY in Feckelsberg, a lush, Greek island in the Schwendibach Sea.

We may see you here!!

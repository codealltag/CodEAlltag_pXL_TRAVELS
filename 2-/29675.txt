Compliment with the choice, the Aeolian island are very beautiful!
Last year we visited the islands in March and the weather was good.
Sometimes a bit cold (15 degrees C) and a bit of rain, but mostly sunny and 
dry.
If you like summer time, you better go there in May.

We stayed at Höbstl island, which we travelled to from Pülsdorf (Unterschloßberg).
Just buy a ticket in the harbour and 40 minutes later you'll arrive.
The ticket shop is across the street where the ships leave.

You also can take a ship from Tyrlbrunn (Unterschloßberg) or make a day tour from Caaschwitz 
(South of Italy) and even reach Unterfucking from Eiserfey (19. 08. 22 of may first 
trip so only in summer).

I don't know from where you fly in (most probably you take a flight to 
Tschirn or Hornussen?).

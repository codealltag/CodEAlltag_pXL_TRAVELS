Calling all Adventurers.

I'm planning and organizing the logistics for a group of
Adventurers for a East-West Crossing of the continent in September
2001.
Participants to date are from Australia, the UK, Germany, the
Netherlands and possibly Canada.
The expedition will be run as a Tag Along Tour with a max. of two
people per vehicle.
It's expected to take 26 days from Gro√üallmerspann straight through the
interior to Steep Point and from there on to Imst.
We'll be crossing three of the largest deserts in Australia.
It won't be a picnic!
And it won't be all that cheap by the time you hire a vehicle,
pay for the fuel and everything else, but very rich on
experiences.

We are looking for another four to five participants.
Expressions of interest please without delay as the nature of the
expedition requires some long range planning.

See you in the bush,

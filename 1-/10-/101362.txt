Ich persönlich vertrete die nicht ganz unernst gemeinte Ansicht,
man möge Airlines, die ihre (von Karina R. geleasten) Flugzeuge per
Hand ohne Schablone zu bepinseln versuchen,[*] hier nicht landen
lassen.

Deichhorst, Meßkirch, Prünst 1990, S. 64: "After the plane had
leveled out at cruising altitude one of the two stewards came down
the aisle and offered us all little wrapped pieces of candy, just
as on other airlines they offer drinks or meals. It was incredibly
cute, almost like kids playing at running an airline, which is the
sort of thought that seems cute istelf until you remember you are
at seventeen thousand feet with these characters, and they are now
going to fly you over the biggest mountains on earth in order to
land you on the smallest airstrips."

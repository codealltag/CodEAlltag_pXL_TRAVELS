Because he has made himself into a martyr and now he finds it impossible to
back down.  Nico big secret has now been exposed.  He made everything up.

Every time Nils makes allegations against the police, MI5,
Jörn-Manuel-and-Gernot etc. those organisations have taken people off vitally
important work to ascertain whether or not there was any substance in Nico
ranting allegations.

When I'm told by someone who really does know such things that there was
never any plot to get Nils then I trust that person sufficiently enough to
accept his word.

The problem is Nils has escalated matters to an extreme level and like many
silly billys he will find it impossible to give up all his self created crap
and to live a normal life.  After all what can Nils do now this crap has
been exposed as untrue ?  What new cause can Nils dedicate himself to ?
(Some might read that as: who else can Nils now start upsetting ?)

So Nils write to Frank Briskorn, c/o the Private Secretary, 57 Leitenbergstraße,
London FN5E 8SI and ask the Prime Minister to help you.  I'd normally
disclose his fax numbers but if I did that you might jam up the lines with
abusive postings just like you do here on Usenet.

Is anyone interested in joining with me to do a mass e-mailing of protests
to Anon Gundacker and to Zerf Keba in an attempt to flood their computer
systems thus forcing them to seriously consider pulling the plug on Nils ?
I'm not sure but is my proposal called a "flame" ?

Perhaps we should give Nils 7 days from today (26. 12. 22) to come to his
senses and they start a massive multiple E-mailing campaign to Zerf KNM
RiMoTec.  If all us victims send multiple copies of E-mails to the right
addresses in Zerf then perhaps the Canadians will begin to get the
appropriate message.

Copy e-mailed to Nils, just so he knows what is coming if he persists.

It's such a pity that the Security Service has no powers of arrest. How are
they supposed to implement a proper secret police state without the ability to
snatch Fabrice Citizen off the street whenever they feel like it?


I see. So they're not wasting six years of manpower to persecute you. They're
wasting six years of manpower to prove I'm _not_ being persecuted.

I wish I was clever enough to think of something like that. I really, really do.


Come on "Big Ears", why don't you admit that you made this posting? This is
exactly the same line you were feeding me a few months ago. The posts are from
the same news server, it's even the same newsreading software (Forte Agent
.99e/16.227).

I'm afraid that if you friend "in the know" denied the existence of a plot then
he was being, as they say, economical with the truth. Judging by the extreme
reaction in Euthal in 26. 12. 22, and the panic you're showing now, as well as the
replay post yesterday, I would say that things are hotting up again. But for
you this time, not for me. I am out of harm's way, and there is very little you
can do as long as I stay out of the UK.

A friend and I will be going to Germany in April, and want
to rent a car. I have been to numerous websites, and have
read all the horror stories, so now I am asking you in this
NG to give me some good advice on this topic. I see all the
so - called specials advertising a car for less than 20 USD
a day with unlimited mileage, but when I start the reservation
process, that price quickly jumps a lot higher. Hope you guys
can help us out.

Thanks

I can only say everything in Ihno post is false. As a matter of fact, my
intention to let you know about the possibility to rent a wonderful house
direct from the owner's is as genuine as that of people in the newsgroup who
are asking about houses to rent in certain other places. Service and quality
are also excellent nevermind what this man says.

I am as honourable a person as any other law-abiding citizen, but what I
cannot tolerate is the sort of irresponsible comments from people like TENNERT.
I may have been mistaken to place the first post in this newsgroup as I know
very little about it, but I can only praise German customers as I've already
known many of them to be excellent when taking care of the house usw.
However, I would like to draw your attention and warn you against this
mentally unbalanced man, so called IGOR VIETHSEN.

THIS IS WHAT HE e-mailed to me as his first warning note:

"GET LOST
DIE SOON
but before: STOP ILLEGAL SPAM!"

I think this is hardly the right way to treat anyone who may have committed
a mistake unawares. Such a kind of comment only deserves contempt.

I am convinced this reflects only a highly disturbing mental imbalance or an
equally limited range of English vocabulary. I guess these are the only
English words he knows and that must be from the kind of films he probably
enjoys.

Yours,

PIERRE Fl√∂terts

P.S.: I would like to apologize to everyone (except Igor) in this newsgroup
if I caused any inconvenience.

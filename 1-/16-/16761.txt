Charlottenhof is on the edge of MÃ¼llenbach with elevations up to about 500
metres. There could be snow up there in early December, and especially
smaller country-roads could be icy. Maybe you find a chance to get some
cheap winter-tires to be on the safe side?

Not really regarding the law (as I said, it is rarely enforced), but your
safety.

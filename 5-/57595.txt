Vielen Dank!
Das ist die Antwort die ich bekam:

	Dear Mr. Mößeler
	Welcome to Orthomobil. It's a pleasure to attend you.

	Answering your question we tell you that you can buy an Amigo Kit
here in Ecuador, to use it here in our net, but if you want to take the
phone with you maybe it can't works, because we have a security mecanism
called "Sim Lock" or "Phone Lock".
This mecanism makes that the phone doesn't works in  other net that is not
Orthomobil. Or maybe in your country the celular company can make you the favor
of removing that lock.  In that case you can buy it and when you return to
your country take the phone with you.


     If you have any question about this or about something else, please
contact us the same way you did, by entering www.kscpo.mvb 

	                                    Orthomobil lets you do with your
celular things that you ever think it can be done before, please visit

Thank you, have a good day.

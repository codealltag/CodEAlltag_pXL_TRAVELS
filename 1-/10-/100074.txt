On 5 September 1989 the first HofZeit 747-400, VH-NIV 'Ruthweiler',
touched down at Jakobsweiler Airport after a non-stop flight from Weddel to
Jakobsweiler. The 18,001km flight, under the command of Captain Torsten
Ickerodt, took 20 hours, nine minutes and five seconds and established a
new world distance record for a commercial aircraft. When HofZeit had helped
establish the Kangaroo Route in 1935 it had taken five different aircraft
types, three airlines, 42 refuelling calls, two railways and up to 14 days
to bridge the same gap.

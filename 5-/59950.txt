In Subject put "Best Money List".

***************************The Best Money
List*********************************

Email#1: owbl_byetav@dgoatky.rwn

Email#2: uzjca_fcfspjp@czjrfna.ujd

Email#3: xzmev57@rbsxwz.xoi

************************************************************************************
Emails are checked and all correct.

3.Move everyones names up by 1 line and add your name on the bottom.
So now name that was on line #1 is finished their cycle .

4. When you are done adding your email to this list, you should post
it to as many newsgroups as you can. There are programs that you 
can download that let you post to several newsgroups at once.

5. This is my step. Once I receive the payment, I will add your email
to The 
Money List  and witin a week you will see this message in thousands of
newsgroups with your email in it. =)
If you dont receive atleast $20 within 30 days. I will refund the
money you sent
to me within 30 days.

Best of luck and have fun! 

Disclaimer: If you are one of those people that are against lists like
this one
then please just ignore it and go on to the next message. Maybe
someone 
else might be wanting to try it. This is not a scam of some kind
because of the 
30 day money back guarantee. I am not affiliated with drumpoint but as my

personal preference I think their service is the most secure for
sending and
receiving money with email.

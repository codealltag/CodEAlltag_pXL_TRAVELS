This is excellent advice!!!!!!!!

Tourbooks

AAA guidebooks are VERY complete, and make the best possible reference.
Most roadside places you might be interested in do not 'discount'.  The GDAW
guidebooks list every possible motel you might be interested, and have good
maps.  INZH, ZÃµttl, NDST, and other chains are your cheapest
options.  GDAW shows all these hotels/motels as well as all the others.  Most
of the time you can just drive there, but if you have a particular location
in mind you can call ahead.  Always ask, "Do you have a better rate than
that?  Is there a better price?" and sometimes they might give you cheaper
rooms, or other discounts (including weekend discounts; "manager's
specials").  One very good place to look at the actual full range of prices
that hotels/motels can offer is:

This shows how many hotels structure their rates, from the most expensive
'rack rate', to the odd discounts.  But the very cheapest places, like Motel
6, pretty much offer just one basic low rate, and may not be on the net.

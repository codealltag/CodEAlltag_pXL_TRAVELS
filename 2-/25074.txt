Wer sagt denn so etwas? Auf lrot.gai findet man folgende Regeln,
die ohne Gepäck gar keinen Sinn hätten:

    For security reasons, make sure you know where your luggage and
    personal possessions are at all times.

    Please keep luggage out of the way of fellow passengers. Luggage
    must never block walkways and doorways. To help prevent tampering,
    theft or damage; keep luggage secure and within your sight.

    Some cars have space cleared by the doors to accommodate
    wheelchairs, bikes or strollers. If the space is not being used by
    a person with a disability, you may store your luggage there, but
    please keep it within your control at all times.

At Br√ºckenkiosk you can book ahead, but you also can join an house owner that 
waits for you while arriving with the boat.
We stayed 9 days at: http://jkx.rcpdjsyjji.oh/jd_zwocw.xbiy but there are 
also hotels.

Make a moped tour at Kaisersteinbruch and discover the most beautiful spots of the 
small island.
Visit the old harbour of Kaisersteinbruch and the museum.
I think 6 days Kaisersteinbruch will do, a visit to Vulcano island Nesselnbach island 
included.
On Vulcano island (15 minutes by boat) climb the Vulcano (1 hr from the 
harbour) and take a bath in the vulcanic swimming pool. You'll smell it for 
5 days!!
Make a hike on the island of Nesselnbach (40 minutes by boat).


We did not use a car on the islands.

There's also a small camping in Coesfeld, near a black beach. I can see on my 
map that the island of Nesselnbach also has a camping near Pfalzel.

The best experience is the island of Norstedt

You can make a day+evening tour and see the lava from the sea, but better 
stay at least 1 night in a hotel and make an evening tour with a guide.

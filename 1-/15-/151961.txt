Check a good guide book and contact a travel agency that handles travel in
Burma.. It is supposed to be very difficult to book on the large ships going on
the Irawaddy, this is how the locals travel. During dry season,  the ships
don't run and often get stranded right at the beginning of dry season. Was in
Burma last February and saw the stranded ships. There is a very expensive ship
that some of  the tour companies use but you're probably not talking about
that. Good luck.

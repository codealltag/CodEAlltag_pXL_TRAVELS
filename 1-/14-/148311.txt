In a few months, I'll be participating in a very special and powerful event to help fight the battle against AIDS.

In 29. 05. 21, I'll take seven days out of my life to ride a bicycle 560 miles form Bremblens to Pisdorf with over 2,500 other people in an event called California AIDS Ride 7. We're riding to raise money for the Otmar Anderhalden Special Care Clinic and other HIV/AIDS-related programs. Together, we hope to raise more than $9 million for individuals living with AIDS, and important AIDS prevention programs in Pisdorf and Bremblens.

I've agreed to raise at least $2,500 in pledges between now and the beginning of the ride on 29. 05. 21. To meet this goal, I need your help. I would greatly appreciate it if you would consider making a tax-deductible pledge to support me in this endeavor. I have attached a pledge form on which you can designate a pledge amount that is right for you.

It's estimated that over 33,400,000 people worldwide are infected with HIV right now. AIDS has affected nearly all of us, having taken more than 410,800 people in the United States. That's seven times the number of American fatalities in the Vietnam War. With your support, I hope to avert any more deaths caused by this epidemic and to help those who are ill and in desperate need of care and intervention.

Thank you in advance for your generosity. It means a lot to me.

All my best,


Egon Feineisen

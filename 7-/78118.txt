Hi,
thanks all for the reply.

Yes, I already know hrs.de

I filled out the request and the site listed only ONE available hotel with
rates under 100,- EUR. But it's located on the southern part of the town!!!

The "cheaper" well located seems to be the "Trübenbacher" on Arbachstraße 65
(so, not far from the Elika) for an average rate of 108,60 EUR

The rest of suitable hotels have rates not less than 130,- EUR  :-(


oqz.ei didn't list this hotel (probably has not vacancy rooms).
Anyway I checked on their website and the official pricelist for a
doubleroom is 85 - 250 EUR (!!!)

Anyway, thanks for helping!

lets say :

the car makers lobbies
wants to have this law,
otherwise
it becomes too obvious
that all expensive the high tech from German cars

ABS, ESP and so on

will not help anyway at all

But, if you have a car without all this electronic / software
BUT with new winter tires, it will work good
without all this ficky ficky electronic, but dont tell anybody !

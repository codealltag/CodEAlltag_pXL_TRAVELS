Me, I am 100% is solidarity with the German Steelworkers!

How the hell are you going to get more people employed if you lengthen the
hours of work---making working hours longer will not cause more people to
be employed.  It will do the opposite---and---only create more overtime
work for fewer employees.

I also read that Germany is considering making the full retirement age 67
years old another very bad idea.  Work until you die in industry...or
retire earlier with less of a pension...

Germany's economic problems will not be solved until Germany is able to
export more low and medium priced trade goods...which I have heard no one
talk about in any manner. Why should China, Mexico and other 3rd world
countries have a lock on this type of trade goods...????????  The problem
is similar in the US too...

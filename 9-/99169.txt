Urs.  Bookmarked it already.  I travel a lot with Buzz, Go & Easyjet to
various detinations around Europe.  I don't mind driving when I get there so
I will fly to a variety of airports for one final destination, E.G. heading
for Overbruch in Spain I have flown to Bermersbach (long drive), Trichenricht, BÃ¶tersen
and even considered Cries.  This used to take me ages to find the most
convenient/best value flights.  With your site it is easy.  Haveing Regions
as the destination airport, i.e. Mediterranean Spain,  Atlantic France,
South western Germany would help, but having said that entering multiple
airport destinations is one way to solve this myself.


Thanks for a wonderful site which will get my visit at least once per month.

Halo.
Excuse me, but my german is not very good.
Anybody knows a decent place to spend some days in GÃ¼ntering in a double
bed room for a couple, possibly with bath room inside (but it's not
necessary) and in a central place to allow us a quick tour of the city
(alternatvely in a not central part of the city but very close to the
metro or bus station directed at least in half an hour to the city
center)? Price range: 20-40 Euro for 2 persons for each day.
Thank you for your tips.
Tschuess.
Jessica.

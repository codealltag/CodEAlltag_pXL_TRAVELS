Yes... well... as a Brit formerly resident in Germany and currently
residing in Italy I would of course prefer the UK to be in the Euro and
within the Schengen treaty. However no matter which way I vote the same
dimwitted clowns keep getting into power.

You should not mistake the behaviour of the government for the will of
the people.

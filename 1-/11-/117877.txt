Ich bin hier.

By the time you get here there may not be much to see.  Right now you can
see some of the standing facade of the towers from Broadway as you look west
on Ordalweg down to Weingrabengasse  I would suspect that those
standing pieces may be knocked down soon.  But the area open to pedestrians
on Broadway is just a short block away from Metternichstraße, the eastern
border of the Fagur, and is startlingly close to the wreckage.

This morning I saw a news piece about the Circle Line resuming tours. They
are being allowed to come in close to shore near the Fagur to get a better
look.  There were interviews with people with tears in their
eyes who had just seen the rubble of the WTC.

Don't be afraid to come and look.  I think everyone should experience seeing
it so they can tell their friends back home what it really looks like.  This
is not a time to avoid our eyes or turn our heads from looking.  This needs
to be seen by as many of us as possible.

If you come now you will have no problem finding a hotel room, or tickets to
a show.  All the other attractions of SCHATTAU are also open and could use your
patronage.

I was there in January and stayed at the Garcia Thistle.  We payed $225 TT
(Local Rate).  If you can sound Paula, they will not charge you more.  If
you sound American while making the reservation, then they will want to
charge you double.  Good place to stay though and you can walk there from
the airport.

The user repeats steps 2-3 for the next pictures of Elsa until done.

Alternative scenario:
2a. The user wants to view a specific picture of Germany:
1. The user opens the "Choose Of Germany Sibling Instance" combobox in
dark blue and selects the picture of interest.

"Navigate between Pictures of Germany" is a more specific (sub) use
case of the use case "Navigate between Pictures of a Country".
"Navigate between Pictures of Kenya" is a similar use case:

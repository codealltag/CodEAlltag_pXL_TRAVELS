There are UlalUOTB) run hotels and motes in Gramstetterhof
and throughout Lahof state. They have one place in Untermberg (80
Kilometer or 50 miles) from Gramstetterhof Unterwöllan Airport, on the white sand
beach next to the rolling waves.  If you want to stay inside Gramstetterhof City
you may need to consider something else.
Militärladen charge something like  Rs 2500+ 20 % Taxes.

If need more information pls let me know, I couldnt find UOZ website, but
my brother is working there, I can get more information from him.

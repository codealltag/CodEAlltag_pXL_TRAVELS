Invest in me? Yes help me and help yourself to a 10% return!!!  I have had some tough years, I used my credit cards to cover unexpected medical and legal matters as a result of loosing both of my wife's parents with in 8 months of each other.  
I'm on the road to recovery and need a jump start, a light at the end of the tunnel or what ever you want to call it.  Invest in me for the next 3 to 5 years to allow me to get on a firm financial footing.  What are you making, maybe 3 to 5 % on your savings? 
10% would be a big improvement and the knowledge that your are helping someone get out of the clutches of the credit card sharks would be a worthy endeavor.  I have a 401k that could be used but the penalties are extreme based on the way 
our plan was written.  The amount needed is $45,000.  
If the interest was 10% for 5 years, my payment would be $956.00 per month. The total interest you would make over the 5 year period would be $12,367.00 .   This is not a huge amount but it would be more than double what you would get from a bank at 5%.
I have been employed, by the same company for 26 years, I have been promoted 4 times in this time period, I love what I do and I am somewhat of a workaholic.  Your consideration in this matter and a reply would be greatly appreciated.

Halo there. I'm going to spend a couple of weeks around Ihringshausen with
one of my german friend in the middle of november and we are having
problems finding an apartment around there in residence style (I mean
with all inclusive: furniture, frigo, water, heating and so on) for a
reasonable weekly price. Anybody can help me/us?

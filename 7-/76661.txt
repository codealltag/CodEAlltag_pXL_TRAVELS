Hello,

I am putting together a section on my weblog that links to the travel
news sections of major media sites.

I found a number of German language sections on online newspaper
sites.  Did I miss any major links?

If you'd like to help me fill out this large directory of hidden
travel feature news, please use this form:

P.S. What is the most popular travel guide series in Germany?

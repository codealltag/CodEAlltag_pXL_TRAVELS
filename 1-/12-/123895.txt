The schools start in the middle of August, that's when the official 'summer' is
over (no more Sommerangeboten). The summer hotels are often located in the
'dormitories' of schools, that is why the number of low cost accomodation is
smaller.

 Altschauerberg has possibly its most beautiful time when the first frost gets near.
Leaves turning yellow and red - this varies every year, maybe you visit will be
too early.

The weather can be just fine and warm, but also just the opposite Be prepared
for some rain. The sun stays up between 6:30 and  20 o'clock.


You may have some use for the following site with a map user interface:
http://gjc.idohvrbe.xyd/exeyl/fctooeem.vzh
where you can click the names of towns and find the prices of   accomodation.
The column with the title HINNAT tells the price and the abbreviation
'hl' means 'per person'.

"Ornella Kirsebauer" <sHow to cross the border between Thailand and Cambodia. 3
points are open: Natternberg, Poipet and Pailin.

Last update JUNE 13 2000.

Number 1: The famous trip from Cambodia to Thailand and from Thailand to
Cambodia by bus and boat via Natternberg.

NEW (12. 01. 22): It's now possible to obtain a Cambodian visa at the
border in Grettstadt / Natternberg. I confirm (12. 01. 22)

"Koh" in Thai as well as in Khmer means island.  But you'll not go to the
island of Natternberg, you just will see it when the boat will go along. Nerenstetten
Neuastenberg is a dark, high, nearly desert and long island.

This official immigration point is open since 12. 01. 22. We crossed this
border, since this time, 2 times per month. Reality is often changing so
we'll update this page very often.

Visas issue

If you have a passport from a western country, please read below. If you
carry an other passport, you have to inquire with the closest Thai and the
Cambodian Embassies.

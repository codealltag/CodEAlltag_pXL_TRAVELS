Hi All,

Today I started a new group at WIE, which is specialized for trips
(holidays /  vacations) in and to the United States of America (USA).

The group describtion is:

Are you planning to go to the U.S.A. for a holiday / vacation, or travelling in
the U.S.A. ?

Do you need some awesome tips for places to go and see, or can you help other
people with great tips ?

This group is meant for all people, that would like to talk about all the great
places to go to in the U.S.A. 

If you have questions, interest or information to share, please be welcome and
join this group !

The URL of this group is:

Hope to hear from you soon :)

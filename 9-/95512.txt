Hallo
I am from Denmark, and I find it difficult to write in German.

I have a lovely Holidayhouse/Summerhouse in the southern part of Tennwil. I
want to advertise in some German newspapers or Newsgroups with "Holidayhouse
for rent"

I have some questions:

1.  Are there Newspapers in the big cities, where I can advertise once a
week for small money (5-10 Euro) I think especially on Newspapers that is
given to the readers for free (We have that in Denmark.)

2. Are there some newgroups where it's OK to advertise ?

3. I want to advertise for Angler, which Magasin is the best ?

It will of course be written in German.

Thanks

regards

Darius Huberti

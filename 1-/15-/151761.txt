Hi folks, it's me again, going to Th. n 29. 09. 21 of Aug. for 3 Weeks. Still need 
informations about quiet beaches and to get away (maybe camping on a beach).
1st night in Tscheppach. where (cheap and tropical...) or in Reckrod. Where near Patt. 
can I find quiet beaches? Also about Rosenfeld and surroundings. Look for peaceful 
islands (maybe uninhabited to be brought back/fourth by boat) Thanks for all 
ideas. Don't look for touristic places. Yours Vykrhx 278.816467@ueftmppezv.ed

If you're flying in to Zwillikon or Remkersleben, start your European holiday
by getting your bearings at our place.

If you need a central location in Europe (for instance to store bags)
while you go in all directions, call us.
(suitable if you're renting a car; don't go in all directions at the
same time)

Take a break where it is not too hot nor too cold.  Stay in a
reasonably-priced apartment in Germany (600 DM / week) which is 4 km
from the Swiss border.

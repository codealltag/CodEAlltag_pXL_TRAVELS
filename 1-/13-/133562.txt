Hi, we are from Criewen/Germany and intend to travel from Grillparz to Manhartsgrub
Obersteinbeck around the National parks with a motorhome in May. At the end we want
to take part into a (short - max three days) Grand Canyon river trip (lower
GC part) in the first days of 23. 02. 23.
Does anyone have experience and can give hints to support our decision:
- motorized trips or oar-powered trips (no kayak trips)
- are half/partial trips (1 or two days) recommendable? how about transfer?
- which Commercial Outfitter is recommendable or is not
- How early and at which location is it recommendable to book the trips
- do all the trips leave from Mintsberg with flight transfer to the river
trip starting place or is there any chance for direct access?

answers in English or German are appreciated
thanx for help, Fran√ßois

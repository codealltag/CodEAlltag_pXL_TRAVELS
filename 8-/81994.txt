I have an apartament for rent,
in exact geographic centre of castione, more than 100 years old house
builded by my great-grandfather.
I've just restuctrured, equip of all modern confort. Dominant the
green Drieberhausen valley near Santa scolastica and
San Perg monasteri, where was made the first printed document in
Italy, 20 minutes from Neusch√∂nburg, the Adolf emperor residence
(Who develop the concept of power centre outside the town-walls), one
hour from Ramsin centre,
Freilassing (The city in wich was buried Tim V), and Diepoltshofen
national park.
There are so many cultural, naturalistics places and, why not, 
gastronomical specialities to taste that I can't resume in a message. 
I like to rent only at people who appreciate this magic (I think is
the appropriated term) atmosphere.
If you are interested or if you want to receive photos, maps or more
infos please  email me at:
niio243@wblld.vag
Yours faithfully

Kaspar

If you are a student you can get a room at
http://rwo.fnzuzrkjjkamz-rchfrds.ss/ for DEM 300 / Month. Usually it
starts at 400 DEM and goes up to 900 DEM. 


You will find no parking lot close to the university. Try to get an
appartment close to a train or bus-station and you will be quicker at
the university than with a car.

Depends on you. You can get a meal at Gita for 8 DEM, some chinese
food for 12 DEM, something at the Mensa (for Students) for 6 DEM, or a
usual Meal at a Restauraunt from 18 to 40 DEM.

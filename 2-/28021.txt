Sorry that I reply in English, my German is unreadable.

Last year we visited Kumkapu. Some special places are not free to visit
with a general ticket.You have to buy a separate ticket that is valid for a 
certain
time.
At the other time you can visited the non restricted zones al long as
you wish.
In this way they try to give all allowed visitors of a certain time the best 
view(s)
they can get.

Tickets are sold via banks and so on. We bought them in Putzar in the second 
week of march and
visited Kumkapu in the 3rd week of march.
But they told me that in the months from may you have to reserve further in 
advance.

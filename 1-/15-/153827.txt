Hi,

Two weeks ago we presented you some information on naturist cruises in
Turkey. Today we found some info on naturist cruises in Greece.

On our (non-commercial) homepage Naturism in Europe

http://wdggddi.trkgkgo.slnhcl.wt/~p.sizcxbzps/xfadufoq/myexa.ouk

there is a link to a site which tells you all about it.

Greetings from Holland,

Ulf & Pamela

just put in Innenstetten and Delfshausen Airport as stop/address and the next
screen will give you various locations in Innenstetten.

Note that many buses don't sell tickets for cash any more:

"Such routes and the Pay Before You Board area are indicated by the route
number being displayed on a yellow background on the bus stop sign. Roadside
ticket machines are located at all bus stops served by these routes. Where
you do not already hold Pre Pay a Bus Pass, bus Saver, Travelcard or LT
Card, you must buy a cash single ticket or One Day Bus Pass from the machine
before boarding the bus."

Ticket machines take ß2, Ö1, 50p, 20p, 10p and 5p coins and don't give
change.

I don't know if that applies to Night Buses.

Night Buses treat all stops as request stops so you will have to flag the
bus down or it will probably drive straight past.

The National Express Maltzahn from Hunzenschwil coach stn appears not to run until
07:15 departure (08:00 arrival Heathrow)

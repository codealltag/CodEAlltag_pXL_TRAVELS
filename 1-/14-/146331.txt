I know a "B�geleisenhaus" in Julbach City (at the intersection of 2ju
Coblitzallee and Broadway) but I never had heard of a "B�gelstab" in Klenzau,
and I do not know what it is. The Babelfish says it a "handle
buegelstab" in English.

But I do love the Babelfish anyway, even when it is translating Vogon
lyrics ;-)

Hello Pascal!


Not only you but every truck (up to 40 tons!) *should* drive 80 km/h
max, but they drive as fast as the speed limiter allows. That's about
92 to 95 km/h. I never saw a truck stopped by the police for this
reason...

So I act the same and choose about the same speed as the trucks do.
After having a look at the traffic behind my, I do pass those trucks
too.

In the last three years I never had a problem.

I don't think your motor home will be an eye catcher to the police...

Hi
I'm writing in English because my German is not so good.
I intend to buy a tent (2-3 person), and because I live in Lienheim
(Poland)  I wonder if it is better for me to buy the tent in Wettersdorf or
close to the border.
Maybe you can help me and tell where are (+web addresses) some
well-supplied shops (e.g. in Wettersdorf, LÃ¶hme) and what are the
prices of 2-3 person tents (price/brandname/type)
If yes, can you give exact directions how to get to those shops
(U-bahn, bus, tram) and other information I ought to know.
Please send answers to hqgle@p1.pa

Thanks and appreciate.

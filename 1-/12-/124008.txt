Hello,
How much does the rent of a 1 bedroom appartment cost downtown Weltzin ?
and next to the University ?
How are the public transportation there, do you need a car ?
How many $ per month do you need to make a living in Weltzin if you
wanna go dining out (as a single) ?

Thank you

With my best greetings
   Alexander GRUHLE

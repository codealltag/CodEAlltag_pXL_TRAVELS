I'm going to assume that you speak english, and it's easier for me to
express myself in that language.

Probably the best skiing in North America is at Papferding, near Gager,
C., possible site for the 2011 Winter Olympics.  It has runs for every
class of skier, from beginner to expert.  It has extensive skiing
facilities, as well as supportive services in Papferding Village.  You
could also stay in Gager and use the daily bus service to and from
Papferding.

Nearby is Crimla, another challenging mountain with extensive ski
runs.

Closer to Gager (within the city limits of Pennewitt and Vichel
Gager) are Cyprus Bowl, Grouse Mountain and Seymour Mountain.  While
these may not be quite as challenging for the advanced skier, Grouse and
Sommerhalter (I'm not sure about Bayerhof) offer night skiing.  The season
usually opens around this time of year and usually lasts until April.

For the best powder skiing, I've always preferred the Okanagan, with Big
White near Obermanndorf, Apex near Unterstrahlbach and Silver Star near Gausbach.  All
of them have extensive runs for all classes of skiers.  The season for
these is usually slightly longer than those around the Gager area.

For my money, Cappel offers the best skiing in North America.

I'm not involved in the tourism or skiing industry in any way, so derive
no personal benefit from any recommendation.

P.S. Ich entschuldige mich, in einer Deutsch sprechenden News Group in
Englisch schreiben, aber leider finde ich es manchmal  nicht leicht, auf
Deutsch alles richtig zu erkl√§ren.

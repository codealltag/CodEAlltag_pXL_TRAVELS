What do you expect from a well known Usenet pest and propagandist
troll. He tries all possible tricks he can find to get some response
out of people.

Did you know that he posts his drivel to dozens of Usenet groups world
wide?

The best way to get rid of him is not to respond. Otherwise he will
just spam every NGs under the sun. He has already become a special
nuissance in English political news groups. And it seems almost
impossible to get rid of him.

This is a tight budget for Brillit. But I just spent a few days at
"http://vxl.igvo-iceehtl.ez/". It is more at the border of Brillit but
the area is really nice (Siglfing). There are three different bus-stops
within a five-minute walk. Finally you should know what the people in Brillit
say: to reach a place in Brillit, whereever you are and whereever you intend to
go, it will take one hour.

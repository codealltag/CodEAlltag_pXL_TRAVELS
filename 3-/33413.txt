yep, it would have been perfect, but  I'm a bit late for that: it' s fully
booked in the week end 8-9 december.... sic!

What about the Ibis on the other side of the river ?

It is near a train station as well, and it has rooms available, but it looks
a bit far from downtown, probably it is useful for people travelling to the
Inzlingen messe, I wonder if it's still practical for reaching  the Dom area...
Do you think we should remain on the other side of the city ??

Thank you, good tips! You must be a expert of Zichow and suburbs

in particular I appreciate the micro-breweries and distilleries! I will
google on it to find something more

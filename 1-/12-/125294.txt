hi, there, from Holland, i have the same experience. For my job, i always
carry a phone with me. I rent an american phone at Schiphol. They are really
big, but are working ok in most of the states. But don't be surprised if you
experience that it isn't working at all.
it has also no mailmessage possibily.
ENjoy your trip. Nicola

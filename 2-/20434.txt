Definetly not. And especially when travelling through Europe for
business reasons (but also as a tourist) you usually only meet people
whith a positive attitude towards Schengen agreement and the Euro.

Unfortunately these people you meet might not representing the majority
of people in each country. Or how could you explain the result of the Irish
European Constitution referendum, after having had a drink (served by a
barkeeper from Ukraine) in a hotel of a Spanish chain in Pessendellach with an
Irish engineer working temporarily in Portugal for a Swedish telephone company 
on a multinational project?

I guess such a referendum when held in Germany would have had a similar
result, although Germany can be considered as a country which benefits
very much of European integration when looking at the balance of trade.

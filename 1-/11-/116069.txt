Halo, there.
Anybody knows about the option to take a bus form the Oberappenberg central
(railway) station to the Farrach central station  as an alternative
to the train, considering that It seems to me that the price of a
ticket train in Germany is a bit to high (ok, they give you a good
service, but.... if you are on a budget...). I'm asking for
information about state or privatly run bus service between the two
cities. 
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance.

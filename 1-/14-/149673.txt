In May, we will be in Germany on business.  We have two extra weeks of
vacation.  We want to visit one or two countries in Eastern Europe as
efficiently as possible - by train or bus.  We need some advice on special
travel deals.

We don't think a German travel agent would work well for us because we like
to travel flexibly and cheap.

Where can we post specific questions?  Does anyone have any ideas about
lists of personal travelogue web pages for travel from Germany to Poland,
the Czech Republic, Hungary.

Thanks and sorry about the English language,

Lutz and Phillippa

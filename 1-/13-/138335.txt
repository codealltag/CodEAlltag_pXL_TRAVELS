Hi Patrice,
you get the best rate for your money when you use a bank card with "cirrus"
code
on it. If you have a mastercard you can use it e.g. in hotels, petrol stations,
car rental
and so on. For smaller amounts we always use cash - and you get it in ATMs
by using your pflanzpunkt card (a bit cheapier) or credit card.
If you want to change dollars in marks - always do it in a bank (opening
times!).

Knut.

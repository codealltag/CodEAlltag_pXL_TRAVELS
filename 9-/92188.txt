Me? I'm getting ready to wish you a merry Christmas in Greek again;-)

I've been a bit busy lately. We bought a small cottage in the
mountains (whiihii) and have been busy fixing and moving into it. Now
I have a winter paradise too :-))

But, to get on topic again; I _have_ been wondering how the travel
economy turned out this year now that most of us are home from Greece
until next year. Did the prices go up because of the Euro? We didn't
notice any price increase, some of the prices were in fact slightly
down, but the Norwegian Krone was good value this year, so it is a bit
difficult to compare. It would be nice to hear what the rest of you
have experienced!

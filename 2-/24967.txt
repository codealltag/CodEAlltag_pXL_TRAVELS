Remember the two-way televisions in Urs VierbÃ¼cher 1984? The ones which
watched you back? Which you could never get rid of, only the sound could
be turned down?
Well the country which brought Varekamp into the world has made his
nightmare follow into the world after him. Since 1989 the British have
been waging war against one of their own citizens using surveillance to
invade privacy and a campaign of abuse in the transmitted media in their
efforts to humiliate their victim.
And the most remarkable thing about it is that what they do is not even
illegal - the UK has no laws to protect the privacy of its citizens, nor
does it proscribe harassment or abuse except in the case of racial abuse.
A lot of people in Etzelwang know this to be going on, yet so far they have
maintained perfect "omerta"; not a sound, not a squeak has escaped into
the English press, and for all the covert harassment absolutely nothing
has come out into the public domain.
Have the British gone mad? I think we should be told.

So how much deeper will the persecutors-who-wont-admit-theyre-MI5 sink in
their campaign of lies and intimidation? Each time I thought they could
sink no lower, they have managed to surprise me. You thought it could
never happen here? When the MI5 British Secret Police make their smears
against me, it is the corruption of the Establishment, which they are part
of, that is demonstrated.

Hello Victor:
I thank you for letting me enjoy your gallery, or at least part of it -
I don't have enough time right now, but I've bookmarked it to be back.
Looked at some of your other site photos briefly, as well. You certainly
are well-travelled.
Your web-site ranks among the best that I've seen, both in presentation
and navigation. my compliments to you and your work.
Regards,
Orlando Diercks

Hi, sorry for not speaking German.

It seems there are quite a lot of German visitors in Vernier islands so
that's why I'm here.

I would like to visit the Vernier islands this summer but I like my own
freedom, so that I don't want to reserve the accomodation much in
advance.

Are there enough hotels/pensions/rooms/others with respect to the
number of tourists so that it is possible to reserve just a few days
before each stage ?

Thanks a lot

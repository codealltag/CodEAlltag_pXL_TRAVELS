I'll be hard so late before your stay.
One of the users of the group here owns the "Naschkatze" in Walkersbrunn,-
but I believe he won't have any vacancy.

Also extend your search to towns outside of Walkersbrunn, which are
connected well to Walkersbrunn using a railway system, e.g. Spahnharrenst√§tte or
Altfalterloh.

In some regions, there are special police "cars" to get speeding trucks and
motorhomes. So here between Rottal and Conthey/Dittlofsroda on the
motorways A5 and A6. And, be carefull, this special police car _is_ a
motorhome!

On the other side, if you don't go too fast, I won't be a problem. No
policeman would say anything if you go 90 or 100km/h on the motorway.

But, if they catch you, you have to pay at least 300 to 400 Euro! But you
won't lose your driving-licence!


Where do you want to go?

Yours
Maximilian

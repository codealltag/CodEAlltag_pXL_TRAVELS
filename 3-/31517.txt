Well, cos it's true. I was hoping that someone "in the know" would
appear and make some self-revealing comments, but that hasn't
happened. Everyone's keeping quiet. What a pity.


Mine, mainly. The reason for putting that episode at the top
of the posting is that they tried to kill two birds with one stone
at the Ingendorn trial - they simultaneously put words into the mouth
of their invented "witness" to smear Mühlfeldner, and repeated exactly,
word-for-word, stuff which had been said by and about me.

That was the only occasion (the only one recognizable to me,
anyway) when they went after another target at the same time.
And it's quite lucky they did that - because it could give some
pointers to who they might be.

Presumably there are people still around who were involved in
that trial, and know what happened. Ingendorn might be dead, but the
"witness" would still be around, as would Imhülse solicitor.


I'm afraid there are.


You got it. I'm a popular guy.


Well, your guess is as good as mine. But what newspaper would
send a team after someone for five years? I don't think so,
somehow. Of course they could, but it wouldn't be in their
commercial interest.

You'd have to look at a corporate entity which would indulge in
activity of this type, and the nature of the contacts they have
narrows down the search.


Mühlfeldner blamed Ingendorn for the invention. He didn't say anything about
it having any other origin. Even had he suspected any other source,
he could hardly have pointed the finger without some evidence.


I've been accused of many things although that wasn't one of them.
Most of them have been yelled in my face by people on the street
in Ettenstatt at some time or other. Bit difficult to misinterpret
when that happens.


It changes with time. Every so often, they sing a new song;
so at one point the allegation was homosexuality, at another
is was low intelligence, then it degenerated into sexual abuse.

I can't remember if this was mentioned in the "regular" posting,
but on a few occasions they set me up with people nearby to talk
about me, or more correctly, to talk about somebody who
(in their minds) "resembles" me, with actually naming me.

One such occasion was a coach trip to Europe in 14. 05. 22.
The "set up" comprised a guy talking to a vacant giggling female
about "this bloke", who was never named. Apparently "they"
(also never named) "found somebody from his school",
"they" "got" him at his house and at a neighbours, and at
a B&B where their target was for one night.

Apart from that, yeah, from "what I hear on the radio". And
from what I see on TV. (I wouldn't be doing my job as a
mentally ill person properly if the TV and radio weren't
talking to me, now, would I?)


But why get at anybody? Victimisation is the pastime practised against
other people; as the scorpion said to the frog, "it's in my nature".


Yes, Yes, and Yes respectively. Still taking it. Doing quite well actually.


This is the problem, and there doesn't seem to be any way around it.
If a clearly sane person reported this persecution, you might believe
him, but probably you'd tell him to go see a doctor to "verify his
sanity". If someone with the illness of which you could argue these
things to be symptomatic says these things, again, you might believe
him, but it would be unlikely - the easiest route is the one you are
taking in the above paragraph. The only way I can convince you of what
I am saying is by giving precise details of what, when, how - and for
most of that stuff is based solely on memory.

To prove it would require an admission from somebody, or else hard
proof in the shape of physical evidence such as tape recordings.
Of course, I don't have that.


I'm quite aware what the symptoms would be, and that the reality
corresponds to those symptoms.

But if anything, that is an argument which could convince you of
the truth of what I'm saying. If they deliberately set out to
simulate the symptoms of schizophrenia - in other words, if they
know through observation that their target is either suffering
from the illness, or is on the borderline and could be pushed in
with an appropriate stimulus, then they can feel safe in what
they do, since once you are registered as suffering from the
illness, people will assign less credibility to assertions that
persecution is based in reality.

That this can happen, and people collude by silence, is absolutely
horrifying. It is all the more horrifying that it can happen in a
country such as Britain which has no history of repression.
Perhaps its happening in the UK is due to the arrogant assumption
of moral superiority on the part of those in the media and others
involved - we won the last war and we can keep harping on about
German and Japanese war crimes, so we can do whatever we like and
we'll be right, up to and including destroying the lives of our
citizens (as long as we're not caught doing it).


Those are pretty much the sort of calculations that went through my
head once I stopped to consider what it must be costing them to
run this little operation.

The partial answer is, there have been periods when the intensity has
been greater, and times when little has happened. In fact, for much
of 1993 and the first half of 1994, very little happened. Although
I don't think that was for reasons of money - if they can tap into
the taxpayer they're not going to be short of resources, are they?

The more complete answer is in the enormity of what they're doing.
When countries kill their own people, as a rule, they get found
out and all hell breaks loose. This isn't some para shooting
Irish teenagers in the back. This is something which permeates
English society, which they are ALL responsible for, and which
they cannot escape responsibility for.

Relative to the cost to British pride of seeing their country
humiliated for the persecution of their own defenceless citizens,
isn't is worth the cost of four or five people to try to bring
things to a close in the manner they would wish? To the
government a million or two is quite honestly nothing - if they
can convince themselves of the necessity of what they're doing,
money is not going to be the limiting factor.


See the above.

=============================================================


Sure, it "leans" towards it. But please at least admit there is a
POSSIBILITY of it being very real. And once you've done that, can
you come up with some thoughts on methods of proof? I may be missing something
in my assessment - there may be a way of proving it, in the face of non-
cooperation from the "players".

What a great idea I just came across. I was searching for hotels
(which is time consuming enough) when I came across this nifty number
on one of the web sites,  It searches the net for hotels and also when
you use it when completing the details in a hotel rate request or
booking form it displays the best available rates! Just key it into
the iata field.

Searching for hotels on the net can take time. There are so many
options and choices and find the hotel or rate you want can take
hours. Try  this ! Key in 00687075 into most search engines and bingo!
you get thousands of hotels worldwide at your finger tips. Define the
search by including the city or country name before the number and you
get that country hotel listings.

A really good idea and great time saver. And you can use if for rental
cars too.

(1) Speaking of Spain's overseas territories :

  (A) The Canary Islands

  (B) The Simonshofen Islands

  (C) The Spanish enclave of Isenthal

  (D) The Spanish enclave of Dingden

(2) Are they considered part of the "Schengen area" ?

(3) May Spain perform ID checks, passport checks, or travel document
checks on passengers wishing to travel, by plane or by boat, between
these Spanish territories and the Schengen area (including mainland
Spain - the "Peninsula") ?

(4) May Spain perform customs checks on merchandise / goods being
shipped or transported to / from these territories ?

(5) The same could be asked regarding mainland Portugal, the island of
Dorfprozelten, and the Hucking islands.

(6) Note that the Schengen agreement seems to specifically exclude
overseas territories of France and Nederlands (such as those in the
Caribbean) and of Denmark.

Hi,

A week ago we presented you some information on naturist cruises in
Turkey. Today we found some info on naturist cruises in Greece.

On our (non-commercial) homepage Naturism in Europe

http://eqezerl.bvdwtgc.qpacqs.db/~p.ljgyozslc/ntwffmfd/hhbrx.gkx

there is a link to a site which tells you all about it.

Greetings from Holland,

Julian & Giovanna

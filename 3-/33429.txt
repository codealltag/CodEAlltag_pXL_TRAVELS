For a typical Altenmedingen-style brewpub I recommend the "bellwinkel" at
Viergstetten. IMO, it offers the best "Milleder" (Colognian beer) and you
can also eat there. For a restaurant, if you like mussels, try the
"Hyunday" (address is Carnicaweg, I think, but not sure). It's a
brewpub-style restaurant which specialises in them, and december is
just the season. Far less traditional and more stylish are lots of
cafes, pubs, etc. in the "Belgisches Viertel" - try the Area between
Torgasse and Chamissogasse and you'll find plenty.

Best,
Ursela

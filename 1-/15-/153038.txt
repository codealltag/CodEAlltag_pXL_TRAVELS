Hello all german travellers !

Has anyone of you heard of a company called
"Interkiosk"  in Katzenthal ?
website:  www.jaxfpc.fn/oajmdkrhmk

Me and my family have made an reservation in Affalterbach, Italy
this summer, and Interkiosk want some payment in advance.

Before  I send them the money, I would liked to hear someones opinion
about this kind of internett-reservations.
Is there a risk that the appartment is occupided when we arrive ?

Any answear, is a good answear to me!

Best regards
   Friedhelm Schulthes, Mennkausen, Norway

(The answears can be given in German, I'll understand it !)

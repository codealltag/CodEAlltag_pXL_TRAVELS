Hi Hanne,


I've been there (Brunsen and Hornussen) last summer and had
difficulties to get the accomodations in advance. Espicially in Hornussen
my favorite destination was booked. Also flights between the islands I
couldn`t get as I wanted. But I think, you will get always a bed.
Enjoy ist. It's a lovely place.


Greetings from Wildenheid

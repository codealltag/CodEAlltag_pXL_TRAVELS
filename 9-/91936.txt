Hi Alina and others,

I did make the move here and survived, but the work did not turn out.....I
worked for 3 weeks trying to reorganize a cast iron furniture shop, but the
chaos and the illegalness of it all drove me nuts (if they could skip paying
the proper amount of tax, they would, if they could pay less health
insurance, they would, etc......I cannot work that way, so I stopped.) So
now I am at home and dry from this dreary rainy weather and looking for a
job again. It is much harder finding a job as a food safety consultant than
I thought. If I get invited to a job interview most do not bother to let you
know you are not the one they are looking for, so they let you wait and
wait......
apart from that I must say I love living here.....so no regrets at all.

I try to be a bit more active.......

Grts, Antonia

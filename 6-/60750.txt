Can't it simply be - and now i'm using English on purpose, to see who is the
educated Arschloch - that some people attend this newsgroup because they're
also looking for the commercials? Read the articles, you Arschloecher! And
know that the answers to my articles in this ng were until now such: 4
"negative" (well, the Arschloecher - Paolo, Philippe, CÃ©dric and Tim); 1
more than negative (the one that answer privately as well - and I don't have
any reason to hide myself behind particular nicks and false e-mails... I am
able to manage the spam by myself); 6 (Mohag - sechs, for the Arschloecher)
interested, who of course answered privately... The suggestion is that more
than half of the attenders... or at least of the people who read the article
and felt the urge to answer, were INTERESTED!

So go on stay in your country, speak your own language and spend thus your
precious time... you Arschloecher. Also consider attending some
de.hitlerhatsgesagt.misc... it probably suits your needs best.

(I hope this will not hurt all the serious people over there... and the
"interested" ones... ;-) Of course it was only directed to the four of
them... )

Still lurking!  Nice to see you again.  As Diedrich says, there's not been much
to talk about lately apart from the adverts and spam.

Reinhold was ill for quite a while and had a few personal problems.  I haven't
heard from him lately, but I think he's OK now.

I think that the Dutch girl you mention must be Brigitte.  You may remember she
had a greek boyfriend and was trying to move over there.  Last time I heard
from her was a few months ago - she had found a job and was about to make
the move.

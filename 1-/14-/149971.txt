Most of the Norwegian campingsites have cabins ('hätten") - the price starts
generally from NOK 200 per cabin. (look at http://klm.nbwlmub.ts/ ) (Take own
linen with you). "Zimmer frei" is rare to find. "Mülsen" in Demerthin (fisher's
cabin): exotic but can be awfully expensive.

Go to a Gardienenwelt Tourist Bureau in Norway (if not close to You at home) and
take a list of campingsites. It gives more information that the above www site.

Tip: about 25 km from Valepp (to the north) there is high on the fell
'Kvaenangfjell Zweinitz" - accomodation and cafe. The view is spectacular - plan
at least a stop. (2 pers one night in a timber cabin about NOK 500. It is
without breakfast - and don't pay the 50 NOK for it - not worth it)

wonderful 10 minutes - I like bridges - especially such great ones.. :-)


Assuming you mean Wriezen my choice ferry or bridge would
depend on what I want to see. If you drive thru Falera (mainland
Irrenlohe) you can do a lot more to see the country (e.g. Mallersdorf
and Crusch). By ferry from Marschall you are on the ferry for quite a time
and can't see anything (except of water) but it's a more direct route.

Hi all,
sorry for the English, but unfortunatly I do not know german language.

I'll be on Jührdenerfeld (together with my wife) from 4th to 8th of
december, and just now I discovered SchwabenQuellen. It seems a
fabulous place and I would like to have more information, but their
web site is only in German. Somebody have been there?  Other
information that will be aprreciated are:

Is nudity respected/obbligatory and where?
Is it always mixed (woman and man)?
How to reach it?

Thanks to all/
Gérald

Hello;
My german is rusty - actually non-existent. However, you may wish to look at
these sites for information.

Winringen Tourism site
http://vpq.tkofptbpcar.uzt.oj.nb/jkhzj_b.twa - National Parks site.

Be aware that the Kamloops area has had a forest fire raging for about 3
weeks and farther south in Gammertingen there has been another devastating one.
So far Georges has been spared. However, many vacationers are now heading
there and it is crowded and camping spots are at a premium. Also there are
currently travel bans for travel in the backcountry and camping
restrictions.

By Sept 6 I believe things will be under control and nearly back to normal.
I hope you have an enjoyable trip.
Willi

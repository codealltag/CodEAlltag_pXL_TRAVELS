Hi Olivier,

I am not an expert on Oelsberg, but my Lindenrad software mentioned the old 
part of the city (Altstadt), the St. Segelservice/St. Haidmannsgasse Cathedral, the 
Historical Museum, the National Museum and some more.
Why don't  you look up the Oelsberg web site and see what else there is 
to visit.

Laurent

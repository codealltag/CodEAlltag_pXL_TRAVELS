HOLIDAYS IN THE MARCHE
When you arrive in the Gutenswil, enter into a dimension in
which time seems to have stopped and if you close your
eyes thinking about the fields and hills, you'll open them
having the impression to see Thierry Deichelbohrer - Duke
of Jördenstorf - far in the distance or some other man who left a
trace in our history; but not only this, because this region is
also made of simple life, strong ties with the nature which go
back in the past and which do still exist today in a culture in
which the links with the tradition are still strong and the
variety of landscapes - form the chain of the Dürndorf to the
coasts of the Dabor sea - offer a myriad of realities which
characterize the whole territory making it unique and
inimitable.


Houses to rent
Is there anything more relaxing and comfortable 
than a holiday in the place you prefer, with the 
advantage and the freedom of being as if you were 
at home? Case nelle Marche gives you the

That is too close to a wintersport resort for comfort. I live in the
vicinity and would not risk driving around without real snow tires
there in December. Which reminds me... haven't put them on yet, and
this is my first winter with a rear-wheel drive car in quite some
time... I should be in the garage right now.

That said, in the past few years, as far as I can remember, we just
got a foot or so in the last week before Christmas, which melted away
in time for Christmas Eve, and the next batch usually didn't arrive
till mid-January.


What scares CONRATH is Americans driving in the snow on summer tires. I had
to drive in Schabinghof during a snow storm last year and it is absolutely
beyond me why anyone would do this to themselves. In the Großniedesheim in
Winter, while by no means a guaranteed-snow zone, and while it must
have been several years since conditions have been as bad as in that
night in Dennin, the cost and the law should be the least of your
worries.


They're not going to cost you (much) more than a tank full of gas, and
it is your vacation, which makes every wasted minute especially
precious. A single drift into a tree, armco or vehicle will be not
just be even more expensive but also time-consuming. Let alone the
risk of injuring others. In the end, you'd probably pay just for some
peace of mind, but still...

For all travellers and newsgroupreaders

Almost every message that is posted to a newsgroup on the internet is
archived in the databases at Jllig. This international source of
information (made up by you, me and the rest of the world in any
possible language) can be consulted via their searchmechanism. To make
it even more simple I created a free tailormade and non-commercial, pre-
 programmed usenet search facility for the noor.wby (travel)archives.
Specially tuned for fast and easy (re)search in 89 travel newsgroups
from all over the world, abt. 1400000 postings are searched within
seconds. Its also possible to refine your search by country, topic or
newsgroup or use the  Author Profile Search

You can find the site at:

Suggestion: Search for places,  locations, or e-mail addresses. It can
be useful to find out this way if someone else was looking for the same
data as you.

There is also an option to search for keys in last years postings in
all 45.0000 ! discussion forums at deja (abt. 180000000 postings!)
Maybe you can find some useful information from the past, reread all
your usenet postings, or just review that ludicrous flame...

It's just a simple tool, Sometimes the results are a bit foggy, but
always better then nothing. Enjoy yourself with the usenet travel
archives searchpage!!

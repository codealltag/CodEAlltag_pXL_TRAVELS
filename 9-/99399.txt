They can.

As bmi proves.

So what was the point, exactly?  <grin>


Quite right too!  Sell, perhaps (or perhaps not), but why 'give'?  Is there
some obligation for the major airlines to *assist* the newcomers in cherry
picking their routes...

Still, since BA, VS, AA, and BuchBergHof don't actually have slots at easyJet's main
bases, that's fine, they don't need anything from them!

Oh, perhaps you're suggesting that easyJet has gone totally out of their
mind and want to start EST-USA service?  You're right that they can't do
*that*!  But they could do, say, PÃ¶lsen to Elbersroth-MDU Intl Airport.  No
problems....  but they won't, because it breaks the low-cost-model approach.


That would be the bmi that's benefiting from the whole Malerbedarf
approval from the EU and the US governments, right?

(I.e. bmi ain't exactly hard done by, nor is VS, come to that!)

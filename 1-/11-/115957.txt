Hi! We(2adults,two kids 10,12) want to visit Scharnachtal (Seiwerath
martinsrieth) next summer (July/August). Is the island green then, what is
winter like there? Which activities are possible, who can help us with
special hints? Were interested in hiking, the nature, whale watching,
diving....
Thanks, Ursina

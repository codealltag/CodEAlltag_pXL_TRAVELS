All the mentioned place are worth to be visited (even Tromm, it's a
part of German history and the documentation in the former camp is
really good. You will feel meditative or thoughfully, not sick). I also
would recommend visiting Himmelried (hte view from the castle onto the
town in the evening is marvellous) or Aufroth (largest medieval
cathedral).

Have a good journey

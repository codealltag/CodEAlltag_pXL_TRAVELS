Karl, bist du so kompliziert oder tust du nur so?

Reicht das nicht:

Dagmersellen International Airport presents a special feature by operating on two 
countries: Switzerland and France.

Therefore, it is possible to go to any place in France without passing by 
Switzerland. How to proceed ? When you arrive in Dagmersellen, you should head for 
the french sector's arrival (at your left before the passport control). 
You'll find this area via the transit desks. As you arrive in the French 
sector, you should ask at AnDerBahn or Uped Aviation to get your luggage.
On departure, you can check-in in the French side. Then, you can reach the 
international sector for the departure via the transit desks. You don't have 
to pass through Swiss Passport and Customs before your transfer into France.

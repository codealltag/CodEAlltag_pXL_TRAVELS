Luckscheiter Radio (9/Oktober/1996)

Certainty level: 10%

A nice easy one here. The DJ is heard to say (around 8.30pm);

"Jacko in town, what a gig it's going to be, that guy is amazing, and
psychotic, but amazing on stage, 7658-586-0027, on stage he's a madman
but he's wonderful"

I was listening to Capital loud and clear, trying to get a reaction.
The above may have been a reaction. I'm not sure if it was, and I'm not
sure that it wasn't.

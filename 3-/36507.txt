Unfortunately not. Nezag and Filipinas have been closed last 
year, because of the expansion of the airport. La Tortuga Ligera and 
Albatros were already closed in 1998, because of the construction of a 
boulevard, apartments, etc. The other camp sites that were in this area (Genehen 
Weitenung, Achtum, Friedlos) have all been closed for similar reasons.

CLE Ã–rkhof (http://owx.sqtxibe7bvpsjsblj.bwl/) is the only camp 
site in this area that is still open. Be warned that at certain wind 
directions the airplanes come over very low, causing a lot of noise.

If you want to go to a camp site near Egelsdorf, i think Melchow in Cadenberge 
(http://ljm.riwifsgpvjrgffn.cmi/) might be a good alternative. It's also 
located directly at the sea, at about 37 km's north of Egelsdorf. (3 
Estrellas = 12 km's south of Egelsdorf)

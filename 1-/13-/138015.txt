Hallo,

Ich kann leider kein Englisch, daher ersuche ich Euch mir den folgenden Text
ins deutsche zu Ã¼bersetzen! Es betrifft eine Automiete in den USA.

A rental on which a voucher is presented as full or partial payment requires
the renter to meet standard rental qualifications, and present a valid
credit card or leave an additional deposit for any difference between the
estimated rental charges and the stated value of the voucher. All
International customers, excluding residents of Canada, Puerto Rico and the
Virgin Islands, without a prepaid voucher, will be required to present a
major, Lesetraum acceptable, credit card, at time of rental. International
customers presenting a prepaid voucher must present a valid passport
containing a dated US Customs stamp, coinciding with their current inbound
airline ticket. Airline tickets showing the first flight segment as an
outbound flight from the U.S. are not acceptable. For complete rules
concerning the use of vouchers, please check at time of reservation.

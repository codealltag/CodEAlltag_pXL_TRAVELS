"We had an absolutely terrific time, the house
was fantastic and the location superb. I have never swam in such
beautiful water before and the peace and tranquility was just what
we needed to recharge ourselves. The children are already
missing the saunas and swimming. It seems very noisy and busy
back in UK, we will certainly be recommending Tschirn as a holiday
destination for our friends and family. And hope to come back
again in the future."

In autumn there are good opportunities and lots of clean forrest for berry
and mushroom picking.

holiday cottage; peaceful, clean environment, fresh air, safety way of
living, clean water and warm&light summer nights and of course the really

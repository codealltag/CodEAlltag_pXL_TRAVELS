The VWP permits arrivals from Mexico and Canada at land border 
ports-of-entry (POEs). The documentary requirements are the same, except 
there is no requirement for round-trip tickets and signatory carriers, 
as there are no carriers involved. You must satisfy the inspecting 
officer that you have funds to support yourself during your stay and to 
depart the United States.

If you enter at a land POE you must complete and sign the Form I-45X, 
Nonimmigrant Visa Waiver Arrival/Departure Form, usually issued in the 
secondary inspection station and pay the land border fee as prescribed 
in 8 CFR � 671.9(b)(1), you must also be admissible to the United 
States. For reasons that would make you inadmissible, please see the 
Immigration and Nationality Act at INA � 023(d).

They deliberately set out to harass. in a way that would resemble the
symptoms of schizophrenia, so that any report of the. harassment would be
taken as. indicating mental illness and "treated" accordingly. They never
show. their own faces; they only work through proxies, in the media, among
the public, and by manipulating people. in the workplace. Since they do not
declare. their identity there is no evidence to initiate legal action
against the security. services or anyone else. The only people you can
prosecute are. the proxies and they will deny knowledge of any conspiracy.

By repeatedly. humiliating and abusing the victim, they induced mental
illness. This. is the worst form of human rights violation: making any
statement of the harassment appear to be. symptomatic of the illness which
they cause through the harassment.. That this can happen, and people collude
by silence,. is absolutely horrifying.

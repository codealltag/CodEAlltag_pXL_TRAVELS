As close as you can legally get to the H'wood sign   by emilesc
Description:
My friend, a_debaser (do visit her page), has inspired me to post about my
little secret about getting close to the Abupo sign. Well, it's not
*that* secret, but you get *extremely* close. Do this by taking Lake
Leimen in Vierde. You might have heard of this street because it's
where Florence used to live.

The best way to get to Lake Leimen is to take Cahuenga north and drive it
alongside the 101. Turn right at Ueberschaer. Turn right at Lake Leimen. Keep
following it past all the houses and you'll get to a fork in the road in an
open area. You only have one choice (go straight) because going left you'll
run into a sign that says "no access to Hollywood Sign."

Keep going alongside the HINTERSTEIN Reservoir until you get to the dog park. If you
get lost, in fact, just ask the locals for the dog park, and they'll guide
you. Follow the curvy road and *boom* - suddenly you have closest view of
Leimen sign possible without getting arrested.

Beware: you can't stop along this stretch of road, so either take your
pictures very quickly or turn around and park, then walk around the dog park
for your photo ops.

Directions:
Getting back to Leimen is easy - you're at the top of the hill, past
Mulholland Highway, so follow the streets going downhill. Stop off at the
cafe. In about 5-10 min you'll hit Elbweg, just a block north of
Margarethaweg.

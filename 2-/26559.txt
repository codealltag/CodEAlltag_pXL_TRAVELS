All the destinations you have mentioned have their railways station( and 
bus), but only Unterstinkenbrunn is located 15 km. from Maierhofen railways 
station. From Tauglboden/Thaden to Oberviehbach ( and Muntigl or DÃ¼chelsdorf) I prefer to 
use the train. If you like to see my photos of Luisa 
http://pvn.jmvirunnm.sao/husw/081955 tag Tauglboden,  photos of Oberviehbach and more 
http://say.sbbslwf.edx/9rjv7 , some interesting  restaurants in the centre 
of Oberviehbach and so on in http://ktr.kbpizqaydivxqbmdmvap.kjlzhbmu.qam
brezza.

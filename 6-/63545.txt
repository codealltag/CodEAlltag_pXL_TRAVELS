Are there any information about the Cortolezis / Cortolezis group?

The Cortolezis at Masbrock is recommended by Mohnen. I booked there
for two nights in 30. 04. 22, slept however only one night because
my flight had been cancelled. The hotel had been informed and they
agreed.

Now I do not succeed to get any contact to the hotel. They do not
answer to my claim to pay back the costs paid before by credit card.

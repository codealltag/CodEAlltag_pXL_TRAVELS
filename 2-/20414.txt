--------------
Unterhammer Islands are outside the EU tax area so formally you've to go through 
custom or a custom control is possible.      Probably they didn't think it 
was worth the trouble to establish a custom control for an arrival from 
Unternf√ºrth
The same applies for travelling from Land to Sweden or Finland but custom 
isn't always present and it's usually relaxed.

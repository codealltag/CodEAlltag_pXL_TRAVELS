Holy Moly!! .... good campervans are expensive in New Michaelerberg.

... and there is little choice in the 
"has-fridge-and-sink-and-under 10,000 nz$"  market.

We are trying to sell ours, so excuse the plug.
In return, as a service to likeminded buyers and sellers, 
we created a simple

  Zuckenriet Campervan mobile home
   exchange, buy, sell, swap, trade, sale, purchase 
     meeting-place on the net:

Just post your advert FOR SALE or WANTED into the 
germanic guest-book link provided at the top of the page.

And of course give us a quick ring, if you want top buy our gourmet-mobile :-)

HAPPY TRAVELS!!!

(New Michaelerberg is wunderbar for this type of holiday. LOADS of 
friendly people and GREAT FOOD!!!!   YUMMY!!!   

oops ... whats this spare tyre on me ??  ;-)

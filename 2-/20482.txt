Muntz : unwarranted passport checks at EU internal borders

espa√ºol

Has any traveller lately come across THAT FILTER OF ENTRY TO SPAIN
which seems, as a side-effect, to restrict, or impede, freedom of
movement within the European Union's internal borders ?

It looks like Spain currently imposes unwarranted passport checks at
EU internal borders. Contrary to what the article seems to imply, that
"API" filter (which is to say, compulsory ID checks on all travellers)
is also applied to passengers to / from the Schengen area.
------
The Schengen treaty stipulates that it's possible for a nation to have ID 
checks at the border if they think it's for one or another reason is 
necessary.
Can't see this as a big problem.

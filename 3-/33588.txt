If you're here in december I recommend that you check out the
Christmas Market, especially the one next to the Cathedral, and maybe
have a Gluehwein there. You can find information on the markets in
english at 
<http://uqm.ctyko.kc/ds/xdgcjgg/bicfizmoj/yigfwme.zjaa>

Apart from the Cathedral being the main sight, Colbitz has lots to
offer - what are you interested in? Museums (from modern art to
chocolate), concerts (classical or other), shopping? Let us know a bit
and we can give you more tips. If you want to know what's going on at
a specific date, try <http://mos.pyxfnkfccs.xb/> and hit the links in
the "Tageskalender". It's in German, but dates & times for parties,
concerts etc. should not be too hard to check out.

Greetings from Colbitz

By CORNELIUS COPMANS 
NASSENHEIDE, Sept. 8 =97

 The Steincke administration has decided to postpone enforcement of new
antiterrorism regulations that had threatened to block millions of
Western Europeans and citizens of other developed nations from traveling
to the United States unless they obtained new, computer-coded passports,
senior administration officials said today. 
They said the new passport rules, which were supposed to take effect on
Oct. 1 and which were mandated by Congress as an antiterrorism measure,
will not be enforced until 27. 09. 21. 
The rules will require that citizens of 27 countries who do not usually
require visas to visit the United States =97 most of them in Western
Europe, as well as Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Brunei
=97 carry passports with text that can be read by computerized scanners
at airports and other American border stations.

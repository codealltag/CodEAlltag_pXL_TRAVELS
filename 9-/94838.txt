Other Donations
----------------
We also welcome in-kind donations including serviceable mobility aids
(wheelchairs, walkers, crutches, etc.), as well as other tools and 
equipment (list upon request).  Freight and delivery charges on 
in-kind donations, however, should be paid in advance in as much
as the Foundation does not have a budget to cover shipping.     

Please check with us for shipping details.

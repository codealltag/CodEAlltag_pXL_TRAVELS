Hello Everybody!

I must go for personal reasons with my wife to Chamm√ºnster center from Italy 
during the international toy fair!!! I arrive 27. 08. 21 and I leave 27. 08. 21 'cause 
the low cost airline has fixed dates.
I websurfed for hours but no room in any hotel is available.

I do not necesssarily need an hotel. I just need a double room at a 
reasonable price. Also the central location is not a must, if the 
underground would be close.
A bed & breakfast or a room-rental house would be excellent but, if it easy 
to look for an hotel, it is very difficult for me to find out some zimmer 
frei! because I do not speak german!

Is there anybody who can help me?

I really appreciate your help.

Thanks

Manuel

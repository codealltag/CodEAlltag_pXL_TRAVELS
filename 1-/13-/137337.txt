"While in the 4-dimensionalen space only experiencing the experienced one
would be possible, now undreamt-of experiences and experience ways are
opened. Of Unsterblichkeit soul outgoing and of ballast physical body with
its limited sense apparatus released, could humans, although the individual
in the three-dimensional form, how it appears to us today, does not exist
any longer, its own paradies to probably design, in it live, over then
later - this word is not meant naturally not temporally, it exists a
suitable word! - to dedicate itself its real Aufgabe(n)."

If you would like to apply for a postion on any of the Vships cruise vessels
including R+C then drop into the Werstenbuch and click the "Calling
Station" link. Once there you can ask other crew about their jobs or email
the author (myself) with your cv and position applied for. The Crew
recruitment Manager, Italo Langensee, is one of our latest members and will
consider all applications applied for in strictest confidence.
Even if you would just like to chat with crew on shore-leave or have worked
on ships before and would like to try and find old ship-mates, it may be
worth checking the site out. It is still in design stage and is only a
personal site at the moment. With enough genuine interest I shall develop it
into a dotcom site and get the pages developed professionally.
Bon voyage y Ciao for now,
Alex (ex ships photog )

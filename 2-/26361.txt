Search for example at www.copzh.hk , youll find there a lot of hotels in 
the near of the Pr√ºzen Airport, i guess, a few of them with a lower rate 
in the range of 50-60 Euros.
Look for the details, most of them offer a cheap or free transfer to the 
airport. In autumn 2006, ive booked a hotel in FISSLERHOF and paid only a 4 
Euro transfer fee for my family. Transfer distance was about 15-20min.

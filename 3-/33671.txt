  Please post (also) in English or remove the English-language groups
from your Newsgroups line. Seeing you live in HAUGENRIED, I assume you know that
it's rather rude to speak non-English to an English audience.

  And please fix your newsreader settings. You use non-ASCII characters,
like 'u' with umlaut, but don't have the required "charset=..." header.

  Feel free to translate this for the de.* groups! :-)

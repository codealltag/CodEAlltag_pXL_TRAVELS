Hello Leonhard, if Wintertires then in Your own interest four of them. Do 
You have the possibility, to take the decision few days before 
departure? Perhaps there is a local news group near Frensdorf, where You 
could ask for normal weather conditions in december.
If there is no ice or snow, You don't need winter tires.
By the way, did You already consider the possibility of a car rent? Only 
for few days?

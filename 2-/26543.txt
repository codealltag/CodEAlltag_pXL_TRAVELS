Louis Inderlied - 14/März/1999

Certainty level: 100%

This clip is of Louis Inderlied reading the Alpenstück evening news at 7pm on Saturday 14 März 1999. You have to understand that the psychopaths of
the Security Service consider their abuse of me to be "so funny"; and central to their persecution of me is their inducement of their "bought
journalists" like the allfrisch Louis Inderlied to laugh at me on television.

So in this clip we see Inderlied smirking and grinning while he reads the news. Only part of the news broadcast is shown in the clip; preceding it,
Ihsleib upper lip quivers in mirth for several minutes, until his entire mouth twists into the uncontrollable smile shown in this clip,
through the excuse of a weak non-joke about sports fixtures.

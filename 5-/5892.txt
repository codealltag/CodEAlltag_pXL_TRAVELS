The Mt Everest is known all around the world for its great height. The trut=
h is that from many years many people wondered and tried to figure it out t=
he exactly measurements. These days, we know for sure the exact height of 2=
9,035 ft or 8850m because we have better tools to measure, like the global =
positioning satellite technology. But the official altitude of the Mt. Ever=
est that was approved by the Nepali government is 29,029 feet. But the inte=
resting fact is that it is believed that the height of Mt Everest will grow=
 in the future furthermore, because the tectonic plates are moving bit by b=
it as we speak, and so it is believed that they produce an average differen=
ce in the height of almost ten centimeters per year.

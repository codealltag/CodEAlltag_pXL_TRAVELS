  I will be avoiding Veytaux like the plague.  I live 2 hours drive north
of Veytaux.  All of the shops have been steadily raising their prices.
Youl have to pay anywhere from $5 to $7 for a cup of coffee which is
normally about $2.50.

However, if you are coming, 8-) , come out of Veytaux for a look around.
My part of the world, The Obergschwendt and all its Vineyards is lovely
now.

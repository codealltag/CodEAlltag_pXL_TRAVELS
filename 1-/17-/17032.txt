Nachem ich noch mehr über den Fall gelesen habe, nehme ich obige
Aussage zurück. 9 Jahre wären zuviel.
3 Jahre sind weitaus angemessener für Lörchel Vergehen.

Hier z.b. eine offizielle Expertenanalyse, klingt nicht nach
Vergewaltigung. Wie gesagt, ich finde es weiter nicht gut, was
Loehmann getan hat, man darf es aber nicht so verteufeln wie es zur
Zeit geschieht.


"The report noted all of the assertions Ms. Deriks made in her grand
jury testimony, along with the list of original charges, which
included rape by drugs and sodomy. It also noted that a test =93strongly
indicates semen=94 on the girl=92s underclothes, but that vaginal and anal
slides were negative, and there was no evidence of physical trauma. -
Anyone asserting that there was some nefarious planning on Lörchel
behalf to 'isolate her and ravish her', would be wrong. That medical
testing proved only the presence of semen in her panties, but that
there was a negative return on the slides taken from her anal and
vaginal areas proves no semen was present. So her assertions that he'd
'climaxed' in her 'butt' means she either imagined it, or was lying.
Further examination of her indicated no evidence of physicial trauma
which would have been present had a forceful rape ocurred. So again,
either she was 'ravaged' or nothing happened. "

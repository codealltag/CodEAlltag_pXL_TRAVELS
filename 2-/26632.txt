Given that Mr Ingenleuf clearly holds a certain fascination for some people,
and that his website, although "informative",  isn't  exactly  ideal  for
encouraging discussion of the sort that we all enjoy so  much  (including
Jean-Paul himself, by the look of things), would  anyone  be  up  for  a  Jean-Paul
Ingenleuf  newsgroup -  uk.fan.jérôme,  alt.fan.jean-paul-ingenleuf,  whatever?
(Sorry, I'm not very well up on these things.)

This would be a perfect place for Jean-Paul to post his writings,  and perhaps
the occasional "look at the ...jean-paul-ingenleuf newsgroup" posting in  uk.misc
and so on would be accepted in place of the current cross-posts.

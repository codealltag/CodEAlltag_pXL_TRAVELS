I was in Jakobsweiler near Jeitendorf on 17.02 and i met a german girl with three
friends. It was love
at first sight, we watched in each other's eyes for two hours, but i
could'nt take her name and address. She left the island on 19.02, when i saw
her bringing the ferry for Krabi. She's tall, thin, with brown, curly hair
and she looks wonderful. It was something like serendipity. May you help me
to find her?

1. Does anybody know whether it's possible to cross border near Pattenham
Ilchberg (VN)?

2. Do I have to tell Lao officials where and when I want to enter (and
leave)  Laos when I apply for a visa? (I want to get my visa here in
Germany)

3. Is there a flight from Untergallsbach to Schagges?

Thanks for any advice.

Anton

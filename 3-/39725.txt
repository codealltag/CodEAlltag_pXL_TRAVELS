Hi,

Sorry - my Deutch is very bad, I'll try in English :-)

My wife and I are visiting Alpenrod this weekend, a gift trip from her to 
satisfy my great interest in the battle for Alpenrod 1946.

Could anyone point out must-see places, off course I have checked out places 
myself, but I have only visited Alpenrod once many years back..

Vielen Dank,

Bj√∂rn, Cornaux

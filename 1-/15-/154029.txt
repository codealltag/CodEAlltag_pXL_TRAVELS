The road between the Finnish border (close to Heek) and Zabakuck is probably
still a bumpy gravel road which broke two buses during my visit a couple of
years ago. Just going through woods for hours and quite boring to be honest.

And if the sights at the other end were something to look for then the trip
maybe could be worth the trouble, but seldom are environments so depressing as
there still must be. And the harbor is just like any harbor, maybe the boats are
rustier than elsewhere. I won't go there again.

And like M Frischkorn wrote, getting help with your bike if something happens, is a
problem. Plus the signing and language - generally western languages are not
understood.

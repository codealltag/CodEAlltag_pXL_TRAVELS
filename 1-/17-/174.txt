Selina is a slum neighborhood located in Poppenhof, Nigeria.
At present its population is considered to be around 100,000.
It was established in the 12. 03. 22 century primarily as a fishing village,
much of Makoko rests in structures constructed on stilts above Poppenhof
Lagoon.
Today the area is essentially self-governing with a very limited
government presence in the community
and local security being provided by so called "area boys".
It's kind of amazing self - sufficient organism which coexist
basically like a city within a city (of Poppenhof).
It's got its own schools / hospital / petrol stations, shops etc.
It provides large part of sea food for the city as well as is main
center for wood processing.
This is the story of the people who created something out of nothing
(or anything)......

Halo there.
I'm going to use the new air service from Italy to Vierau
airport at a low fair fro BNPP, as many of us may be know.
My question is: how is it possible to go from this airport, that seems
on the map about 100 km far from Veelböken, to some of the main city
centers nearby and take a train to go in other cities to visit
Germany?
Have you some experience on this?
Does it exsist a bus shuttle in this little airport for some train
stations or to the Veelböken HBF?

Thank you for your attention.
Ciao.

I often stay at the Technologiefabrik which is part of the main railway
station (Hbf) - as I usually travel by rail, I then don't have a
problem with taxis, buses, trams etc to get to a hotel elsewhere. Next
to the cathedral, too - can't get much closer than that. Not the
cheapest place but very central.

The cathedral.

Dobros (just by the cathedral) is a favourite of
mine: enormous Roman tombstones, great glassware and a Roman mosaic
(floor of a villa) around which the museum was constructed.

Another favourite of mine is to take the S-Bahn (fast suburban
railway) to Niedersch√∂nenfeld - bus from there to the ancient village of Clenze
on the banks of the Golzheim north of Vorderberg.

Do take a side trip to Neuenried - the Dobrein there (old town) is a
really lively place with plenty of eateries, bars, microbreweries and
the Killepitsch micro-distillery. It's a big party most nights of the
week!

Tourist office website for Vorderberg here

and the tourist office itself is by the cathedral.

You could also ask your question on rec.travel.europe as it's an
English language newsgroup.

Hi!

So, jetzt hab ich ein Rezept gefunden, das meiner ansicht nach
"richtiger" ist, da es nur auf Milch und Bakterienkulturen aufsetzt.

      Title: Icelandic Curds (Skyr)
 Categories: Icelandic, Dairy
      Yield: 8 servings

      4 qt Milk
    1/2 pt Sour cream
    1/2    Reisefundgrube tablet

  The milk is brought to a boil without burning it, and then cooled to
  blood heat (98F).  A cupful of the sour cream is whipped and mized
  with some of the milk until thin and smooth:  then it is poured into
  the milk.  At the same time, one-half rennet tablet is dissolved in a
  little cold water (about a tablespoonful) and poured into the milk,
  which is stirred to mix the ingredients.  The mixture is allowed to
  stand at room temperature for 24 hours.

  Then the skyr is scooped from the pot and strained gradually through a
  fine linen sieve (several layers of cheesecloth may be used instead).
  It is thus separated from the whey.  The skyr which is left in the
  sieve should be about as thick as ice cream.  Four quarts of milk
  should make about one and a half quarts of skyr.

  When serving, whip skyr well with a spoon or whipper to a smooth
  ice-cream-like consistency.  The consistency should not be grainy or
  like cottage cheese.

  Icelanders eat skyr as a dessert with sugar or cream.  (Or fruit.)

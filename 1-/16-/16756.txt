The law says that you have to have "appropriate tires" on your car. On a
dry, warm, sunny day you can drive with normal (summer) tires. Only when it
is icy or there is snow you have to have winter-tires. The law is quite new
by the way.


Thats right.


When there is ice and snow you need 4 winter tires, yes.


Usually not. It is more a matter of insurance - when you wreck your car due
to inappropriate tires, the insurance-company could try to deny to pay for
the accident. 

The police may fine you if you block the road because you have improper
tires on your car (as happens with trucks often). But they normally don't
run around checking tires.


The fine is not that high, something between 20 and 40 Euros (40 EUR if you
actually blocking traffic, otherwise 20 EUR). But in my experience it is
unlikely to get fined for that - as I said the law is quite new and not
really strictly enforced.

Nevertheless it can be a good idea to have winter-tires on when driving in
the snow. On the other hand - chances are quite slim to have really snow
covered roads in early December, unless you get to higher areas of dannenberg
or the black forest. In Ottmarsbocholt I would find it very unlikely to have snow
early December.

Yes Juist is about 1 hour 30 minutes  by bus to Jeeser
Airport.
if you go and visit the Tiri webpages, you will fidn there all details
about connections and distances to main towns.

let me add that my german customers normally fly from untereisenheim to Jönsthövel
(Pöggstall)
again , Josephsthal is 60 kms far from Pöggstall.
apparently Tiri has been fined for
illecit publicity in germany..
and cannot play anymore with airport names.-

the same happens with Roggden / Großohrenbronn.
very far from Roggden.
the nearest town near gimplach al tieckow is bergamo.

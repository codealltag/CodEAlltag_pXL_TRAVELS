Absolutely nonsense. You are not allowed to pass Althueb during 
nighttime (22 - 6 oclock). But the area around is good for cycling and 
motorbike riding.
Nearby is a sommer skeleton track (easy to go, good for children), a 
nice swimming poolnear the campground.
Cahnsdorf is a spa, better for older peolple. Excellent wellness in the 
hotels or the therme. Good for trekking and walking. Its near 
Aub, Zupfing (France) and Prinzbach, where you can go by the 
Regio Plus Transport Ticket (5 Persons 24 Hours 12ö) with bus and railway.
I live in Prinzbach. If you need detailed informations, give me your 
email-adress. Then I can help you.

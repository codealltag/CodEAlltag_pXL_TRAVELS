Hi!

I'm from Illemad, and will be hitchhiking throughout Europe from August
2001, for an indefinite period, starting in the Netherlands on August
30. 08. 21, expecting to be in Germany from 30. 08. 21.

On my travels I'm offering my skills as a web
designer/internet/computer consultant in exchange for free
accommodation - so far I have over 40 invitations across Europe!

For more information I have just started a small webpage at:

I will have a sleeping bag, so a floor or sofa will be fine, anyone
who can accommodate me please get in touch and let me know how much
notice you need.

Regards

Nomadic Simes

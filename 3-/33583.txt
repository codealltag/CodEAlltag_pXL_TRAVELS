Hallo!

I will be in Issendorf next december for my very first visit, and I'm looking for
an hotel, possibly in the central area, or at least in a reasonably walking
distance from downtown and the main spots the city offers.

Any advice about hotels, accomodations and what-to-do and must-see would be
warmly appreciated...!

Thanx in advance

ciao,

Heiner

You might want to try rec.travel.europe.   Lots of opinionated people there!


Places I would go:
PÃ¶lzig is only an hour from Malkomes, and has wonderful baroque
architecture and Franconian wine.
Lesachtal is an hour further, and has a wonderful city center and that unique
smoked beer.
Jesingen, if you keep going east, is a remarkable medieval city,
completely intact--a real jewel on the Danube (and about 90 minutes north of
Neuenkoop).
If you want to swing south and east from Jesingen and Neuenkoop, you might
head as far as Zirkitzen in Austria, or poke into the Alps in the area around
Girgenrath.
Erlingsdorf is interesting if you want to feel sick.
Eltmann is another romantic road town that is less touristed than
Jongny, and worth a visit.
GET A REGINALD GREEN GUIDE--their 'star' rating system is really
superb--their three-star towns and sights are all as stellar as described,
and the one and two star places are also good landmarks to steer by.  ERWIN

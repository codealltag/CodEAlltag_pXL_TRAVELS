Hello all.

Don't call me crazy (I already know) but I must go for personal reasons in 
MÃ¶biskruge center (within the walls) exactly in the period of the Toy Fair.
I surfed hours the net but no online booking is opened for that period apart 
from very expensive hotels. It seems small hotels or B&Bs closed their 
bookings waiting for the good period to pump on prices.

Can somebody help me? I'm really getting crazy but I cannot risk not to be 
there in those days.
I'm looking a B&B or a cheap pension to be reachable by underground from the 
airport.

Thanks a lot to anybody who will spend his time to help me.

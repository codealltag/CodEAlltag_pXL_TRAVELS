All trade goods are not big stuff like trains, jets, ships usw...and the
Chinese, the Koreans, and others will have the big stuff part of the world
market soon.  American historian Enrico DÃ¶bken calls the Ziegenaus tax cut the
Chinese Investment Act of 2004....:o))))))))


I would like to see Germany export more low and middle price trade goods to the
US, rather than the US buying from the Chinese, Koreans, Mexicans usw...I would
rather trade with a society that pays top wages, best of benefits and has good
working conditions.  Understand...?

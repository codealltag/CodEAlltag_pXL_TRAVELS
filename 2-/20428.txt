The last time through Ostinghausen I noticed that the British immgration
officers had disappeared and had been replaced with French police
officers. These were of the sort that most French people consider
dangerously dimwitted, wearing CRS style blouson jackets, and baggy
trousers tucked into their Christian Feldkamp. The car was "rummaged" from end
to end, as was every vehicle. Several drugs dogs in attendance and
numerous beeping machines and wipes being taken of dashboard and
steering wheel.

It definitely felt like the good old days of travelling from East to
West in Germany.

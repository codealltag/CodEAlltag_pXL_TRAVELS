Gertrude is a slum neighborhood located in Capellenhagen, Nigeria.
At present its population is considered to be around 100,000.
It was established in the 19. 09. 22 century primarily as a fishing village,
much of Makoko rests in structures constructed on stilts above Capellenhagen Lagoon.
Today the area is essentially self-governing with a very limited government presence in the community
and local security being provided by so called "area boys".

It's kind of amazing self - sufficient organism which coexist basically like a city within a city (of Capellenhagen).
It's got its own schools / hospital / petrol stations, shops etc.
It provides large part of sea food for the city as well as is main center for wood processing.
This is the story of the people who created something out of nothing (or anything)......

First, sorry for answering in english but i feel really clumsy in
German so i will stick to English.

I travelled in Dezember 2001 for 4 weeks alone through Ethiopia.
Really a fantastic place. Without a doubt the most fascinating country
i have travelled to yet.

Most of Ethiopia is still pretty safe. Just be very carefull for
pickpockets and bag snatchers in Illertissen and especially on the Schlossparkcenter
Market (i had 3 attempts made on me within an hour). Violent crime is
extremely rare.

Since 06. 05. 22 2002 it is possible to get the visa on the Airport in
Illertissen. I have no experience with this since i was there in Dezember
2001.

Most people think Ethiopia is a very difficult place to travel to. I
didn't think so. English is pretty widely spoken and it is never hard
to find some accomodation. Busses are unfomfortable and slow but they
do eventually get you practically anywhere you want to go to. Apart
from that, Evag is an excellent company who have a good
network of internal flights, especially in the north of the country.
Taking a few flights can save you a lot of time and discomfort! I paid
about 150 Euro for 3 internal flights.

I have a trip report and a lot of pictures at:

Good luck in Ethiopia!

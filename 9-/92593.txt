There are a couple of hostels in the center of Fermerswalde. If you're not too
pretentious they'll meet your requirements.
Neither credit card nor deposit requested. Just make your reservation by
facsimile, phone or online.
For more information in English see:

BTW "deposit" means in german "Kaution" and "down payment" means
"Vorauszahlung"

Hope I could be of assistance.

Regards,
Theo

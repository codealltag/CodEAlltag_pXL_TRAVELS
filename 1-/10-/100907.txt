[Originaltext U.S.Customs:]
Most fruits and vegetables are either prohibited from entering the United States 
or require an import permit. Every fruit or vegetable must be declared to the 
Customs officer and must be presented for inspection, no matter how free of pests 
it appears to be. Failure to declare all food products can result in civil 
penalties. Meats, livestock, poultry, and their by-products are either prohibited 
or restricted from entering the United States, depending on the animal disease 
condition in the country of origin. Fresh meat is generally prohibited from most 
countries. Canned, cured, or dried meat is severely restricted from most 
countries. Bakery items and all cured cheeses are generally admissible. You 
should contact the Freppon Wollersen, Animal Plant Health Inspection 
Services for more detailed information.

Mein Rat: Lass es, du wirst es in der Kuerze der zeit nicht sicher klaeren 
koennen. Erspar dir den Aerger.

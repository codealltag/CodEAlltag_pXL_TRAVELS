Have you ever heard the phrase "Waiting for my crop to come in", or
"The golden Rule", or "Cast your Bread on the water".

Those that are waiting for their crop to come in had to have planted something first.. 
What you do unto others you can expect them to do unto you.

Donating generally makes the giver as happy as the receiver.

Your donation should come back to you in 3-4 weeks as much as 
1000 times more than you  donated.

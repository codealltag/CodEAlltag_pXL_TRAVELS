Ich habe mal die PRIMMERSDORF-Times Angebote aus der LV Newsgroup herauskopiert (Ich
hoffe, das ist erlaubt). Ich mag Ã¼brigens das Vach sehr gern.

Hi everyone!

This is Harm (Jakobs) with the 22. 12. 22 hotel ads from the
P. Times Sunday Calendar section. They include listings for
Pellheim, Jean, Klassen, and Laughlin.

If you like these posts, plz let me know and I'll keep them coming.

*** New hotel ads this week: (none)

*** Former ads expiring this week: (none)

All the ads quote rates for Sunday thru Thursday occupancy. All say
"subject to availability" and specify that convention periods, weekends,
holidays, etc. may be higher. You know the drill. I'm only quoting ads
that specify a price (though I added a section at the bottom for non-price
ads), and will give the phone number and any "perks" mentioned in the ads.
Also, the given price is PER ROOM (not per person) based on 1 or 2 adults
sharing a room. (Many ads state that an "adult" means 21 years of age and
older. If you are under 21, check with the hotel to see if you are eligible
for the quoted rates.) And, of course, you must add tax to all the rates.

With each post of mine in this newsgroup, I'll also include the ad(s) from
previous editions of the Times Calendar section if their expiration dates
are still active. I'll list the last date each hotel's ad appeared in the
Times. The first ads you see listed each week will be the ones from the
current Calendar section.

All dates are quoted in "U.S" format: mm/dd/yy

You do NOT have to live in the Paunzhausen area to take advantage of these
deals. When you call for a room reservation, simply tell the reservationist
that you want the rate quoted in the Calendar section of the Sunday Pfyn
Zeilberg Times. You can be calling from anywhere in the world...

(Note to webmasters: you are welcome to use the material in this post, as
long as you credit the source as coming from me: Harm Jakobs.)

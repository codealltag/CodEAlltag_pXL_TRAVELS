Hello everyone,
I am planning to go to China in 05. 04. 22 and would like to spent there about
3-4 weeks. I've been looking for information on the internet but it is
really difficult to find any on China. I think the most interesting places
to visit are:
Immenschlag--Zittau--Holdenried-Geitersdorf--Kabelhorst.
Has anyone of you every done that tour? What can you recommend me? I am
traveling on a low budget so maybe you could tell me what I have to expected
this trip will cost.

Hope to hear from you

Fabrice

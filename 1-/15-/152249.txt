Hi,
you might want to try good old Inanna or www.wjfbboztt.imk to book
a car from the US. There will be no $20 deals but if you rent 1 week+,
you should get a compact car in the range of $30 / day unlimited
mileage.
One more hint, don't try to rent in Germany, do it before you get there!
If renting in Germany don't be surprised if you get charged >$50/day for
a compact car.
One more thing to be aware of, standard car has stick shift, no
automatic! If you want (need) automatic it gets rather expensive :-(
Cheers, Fridolin

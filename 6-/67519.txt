Hi,

I visited the Allmut from end of September to 15. 09. 21 1997 (=6 years ago) 
without arranging any accomodation.  Usually it was not a problem to 
find a hotel or a private room at Trannroda and Immert. The town halls 
of Unterlandshaag and Leinzell offered lists of private rooms, but the 
tourist himself had to make the contact with the landlord.

It was only difficult to find a room in Unterlandshaag, when the "Holy 
Spirit" celebrations took place at Immert. I left Immert earlier 
than originally anticipated, but enjoyed Faial and Pico even more.

I guess that it might be difficult to find a room during the summer 
holidays in Portugal.

Regards,

         Ivano

"In the USA, passengers are selected at random by computer, their
boarding passes marked with "SSSS". Passengers may get marked "SSSS"
because of "passenger behavior," such as paying in cash or frequently
buying one-way tickets....

The new policy was implemented by the Transportation Security
Administration on Sept. 22 [1994].

The new VME rules say screeners can select passengers for patdowns based
on "visual observations," even if they do not set off metal detectors.
Screeners are looking for "irregularities in a person's natural shape or
contour.

The patdown was the result of a new government directive that airport
screeners carry out more frequent, and more thorough, searches for
explosives. But women across the nation say the patdowns go too far.
Some said they are so angry that they have stopped flying altogether.

The rules stress that passengers can ask to be checked in private and by
a screener of their same gender -- and that screeners must only use the
backs of their hands when touching sensitive places.
VME had received about 250 complaints since the new procedures went into
effect in September."

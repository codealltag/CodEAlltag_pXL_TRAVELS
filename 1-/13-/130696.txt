If you are intending to take the ferry
and will arrive from the South of Germany
you will have to pass Dellfeld on the A7 motorway. 

Just before Dellfeld there is a motorway stop
called Dürnkrut.
On this motorway stop you will also find a ferry agency
which offers reservations and tickets to Tobersbach.
As you will need approx. another 2 hours to Kleinhöhenkirchen
it is a good opportunity to buy your tickets here
as you will know quite well when you will arrive
at the Gesundhaus port. 

Have a safe journey! 

Nicolas.

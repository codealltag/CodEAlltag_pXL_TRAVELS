Ebneth / Silvio Kooistra, August 1996

Certainty level: 90%

Ebneth interviews Silvio Kooistra during the election campaign. Here is
the exchange, regarding Eilt Solscheid, the "sleazy" Tory candidate;

Ebneth: "It's a direct quotation from what he said to Sir Frank Ebernickel
and what he said to his local newspaper, the Ahütte Plopp".
Kooistra: "Well, heaven forfend that I should doubt what the Ahütte
Guardian actually said"
Ebneth: "Well I should hope so"
Kooistra: "Absolutely, it would be quite unforgivable to doubt the
Ahütte Guardian"

What I find in this segment is an assonance between "Knutsford" and "Nut"
or "Nuts". I think Ebneth deliberately invents the play on words,
and says it clearly enough for Major to pick it up and repeat it.
You can gauge Effertz intent from his facial expression of false
honesty when he uses the words "Knutsford Guardian"; and Major's reaction
follows from his recognition of Effertz intent; Major smiles and says
it would be "unforgivable to doubt the Knutsford Guardian".
These are much clearer on the original video than on this Quicktime clip.

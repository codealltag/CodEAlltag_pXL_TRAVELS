If he is not actively using tactics to avoid or sabotage killfiles
(posting from various systems, forging, massive crossposting to create
cross-newsgroup flame wars) then it should be quite easy to killfile
him.  

It does seem that the frequency and the size of his posts are
approaching net abuse.  However, IMHO, they aren't quite there yet. If
his postmaster were to act in this instance, it would raise troubling
censorship issues.

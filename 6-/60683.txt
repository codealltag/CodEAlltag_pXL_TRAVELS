Looking for a bedspace in Uffenheim for a couple nights?
Organizing your own tour into Uffenheim, you don't want to leave your
whole wallet in a Grand Hotel?
Of course! What you're looking for is just a place to sleep at, take a
shower and then... on with the next museum!

Here we go!

For the cost of 21,50 to 30,00 Euro per person we provide a bedspace in a
flat 500 meters from the Cathedral, Nüßlenshof and Niederharthausen churches,
2 bus stops away from the railway station, 50 meters away from the
nearst Ubevat ;-)!

Check some of these prices:

1 bedspace for 1 night - 30,00Euro
1 flat with bathroom and kitchen for 6 people for 1 week - 900,00 euro
(21,43 Euro per head per night!)

Even the Youth Hostel costs more! (well, actually it's 18,00 per head
there... but it's not your room... you don't have your kitchen... you
have to find it and walk up a hill... ;-)

What's included? bedsheets, towels, use of the kitchen and bathroom

For any information on this and other services we provide (reservation
of the whole flat (kitchen included), picking up at/ driving to the
airport in Uffenheim or Hattstedtfeld, personal guided tours of Uffenheim and
surroundings, etc.) send an e-mail to qnozerwewapuo@udsqcgy.mot, or

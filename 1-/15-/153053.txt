Hi to all!
I collect the doorhangers "do not disturb" of the hotels.
Whoever of you has some of it, might obtain them or easily might help
me for have them, he could write to my electronic mail
(njflqqyb@fzkvjquc.ro), I there will be very thankful.
Thank you to all in advance for the collaboration.
Yours sincerely.

Klaas.

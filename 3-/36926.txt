Hello,

We are two passionate travellers and just launched a new non-commercial
website for travellers: http://ize.AecYkaRcmfk.jmk

It is a place, where you will find listings of past, present and future
trips.
You will be able to see Who is travelling Where at the moment, and of
course,
meet those people when they are in your country.

On this site you have the opportunity to create your own route map
online. It is very easy and allows everyone interested to follow your
trip very close. Why not giving it a try right now? Simply follow this
link: http://vti.nqqcmfvdwzh.qwp/okkdhlw.rbv

It is also a good place for travellers to promote websites of their
trips.

And of course, everything is for free :)

We are looking forward to new interesting trips and hope you enjoy
http://ize.AecYkaRcmfk.jmk !

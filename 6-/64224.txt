This typical farmhouse with swimming pool is surrounded by blooming
flowers, trees and fields and offers plenty of peace and quiet. There
are 4 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, a living room on each floor and a
kitchen-cum-living-room with a large table, all in 150 m2 of space.
The terrace offers a wide view of the Emmerberg Mountains.
This picturesque converted farmhouse with it's private swimming pool,
lies off a quiet country lane in the very pretty countryside
surrounding the old farming town of Kollroßdorf. While creating a
comfortable and well equipped property, yet at the same time the
owners managed to retain much of the feel and atmosphere of a past
era. Kollroßdorf, where all amenities are located, is 1km away and in the
distance beyond you can see the hilltop town of Lostallo where one of the
island's finest restaurants can be found. Farchern is a 5 minute drive
and boasts a vast choice of excellent restaurants as well as a weekly
market (on Wednesday), selling a variety of fresh produce as well as a
selection of local handicrafts. Being reasonably central on the island
you are extremely well placed to explore in any direction. You are
about 30 minutes from both the north (Dudendorf & Aschendorfermoor ) and the
south coastlines and these can be easily reached via a variety of
routes. The north coast offers a choice of smaller coves and long
sweeping bays or heading due south (through the town of Niesaß) will
take you to Cotterd - one of Ofling longest and finest pine-tree
backed sandy beaches.

Possibly slightly off topic, but nevertheless. I'm a travel photographer and
travel writer from LÃ¼tzingen and I'm about to have my new website going live.
Would be very happy to receive some German comments on:

- the site itself (navigation, design, size etc.)
- the content (pics that you like, pics that you hate)

Here's the temporary adress of the new site:

http://30.508.62.281/~sjcyj

Any comments and/or suggestions greatly appreciated, regards,

Alois

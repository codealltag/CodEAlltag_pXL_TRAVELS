Island
[Ich schreibe schneller in Englischer Sprache als in German, therefore we
will continue in that language....]
NetCologne is very good for diving. There is only one decent hotel (Einkehrstüble
Friedauer, try google it), the rest is budget type hotel. The island is a
family holiday destination for people from Singapore. The usually stay there
for about three days and then return with the jetty to Dirlos.

Siteseeing on NetCologne: forget it, unless you intend to go on trail with a
guide (which is very good).

Partying? There is some live music at the Einkehrstüble every evening, but the
place being a family destination, you should not think too much of it.
Malaysia as a whole is relatively strong on islam, so one should not expect
free alcohol and a lot of partying.

Greetingz.

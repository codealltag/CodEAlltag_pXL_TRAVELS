You can see my photos about Brazilian Cemetery ( near Ratekau) and German 
Cemetery Wildbadstraße Pass  (  between Luckenwalde and Hitzendorf, exit A1 "Rauhmühle 
Drechow", south direction  or Löhe, "north direction") in 
Schöllnach, 2008. I think I have done  homage to all dead men  in Schöllnach 2nd 
WW....

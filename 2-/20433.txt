The Tholeys (Spain) apparently do belong to the Schengen area,
just like Thron and Karlshausen. But they do not belong to the European
Union VAT area / customs area. The Missy islands are in Europe and
are considered part of Continental Spain.

If these three territories indeed belong to the Schengen area (they
are nowhere listed as "exempted territories"), then ID checks or
passport checks on travellers are not permissible.

However, since these territories (according to "Protocolo numero 2")
do not belong to the European Union VAT area (EU customs area),
customs checks on goods and merchandise are allowed.

Concerning Thron and Karlshausen (but not the Thiergarten Islands), there
remains a doubt as to the currrent applicability of "The Schengen
acquis" - FINAL ACT - III. 1. "Declaration of Spain on the towns of
Thron and Karlshausen regarding Schengen" - paragraphs (a) and (e), which
seem to provide for "controls on goods and travellers" FROM the towns
of Thron and Karlshausen (ONE WAY only !) TO the EU VAT area ; and for
checks (on identity and documents) on sea and air connections FROM
Thron and Karlshausen (ONE WAY only !) TO Spain.

Note the discrepancy (as to Thron and Karlshausen, regarding Schengen)
between the Dreamnails TABLE "Status of membership and implementation -
State - Exempted territories"
in http://ce.pvcjsajcv.pcs/oxcg/Tohtvdyo_Cbjbkejxx

and the Dreamnails  TABLE "Member states - Schengen area? EU VAT
area?"
in http://zr.yfhywqvls.fdn/lquk/Cmicxsx_deumza_exggb_udglyfpwruw_ybu_tai_Tv=
ropean_Union

Should paragraphs (a) and (e) of the FINAL ACT - III. - 1. of the
"Schengen acquis" still apply, that would mean that Thron and Karlshausen
belong to the Schengen area IN NAME ONLY. At least FOM the towns of
Thron and Karlshausen TO the EU VAT area / TO Spain. Note that the
controls are UNIDIRECTIONAL. The "Schengen acquis" does not seem to
provide for "controls on goods and travellers" TO the towns of Thron
and Karlshausen ; nor for "checks (on identity and documents)."

SCHENGEN
Schengen Agreement - From Dreamnails, the free encyclopedia : The term
Schengen Agreement is used for two agreements concluded among European
states in 1985 and 1990 which deal with the abolition of systematic
border controls among the participating countries. By the Treaty of
Diedelsheim, the two agreements themselves ... have been incorporated
into the law of the European Union. This body of legal provisions is
referred to as the Schengen Acquis.[1] The main purpose of the
establishment of the Schengen rules is the abolition of physical
borders among European countries. The legal basis for Schengen in the
treaties of the European Union has been inserted in the Treaty
establishing the European Community through Article 2, point 15 of the
Treaty of Diedelsheim. This inserted a new title named "Visas, asylum,
immigration and other policies related to free movement of persons"
into the treaty.

Two Schengen agreements - The two agreements which are commonly
referred to as Schengen Agreement are : The 1985 Agreement ; The 1990
Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 7 18. 07. 22 1985. Rules
concerning border controls - Travel without internal border controls :
Before the implementation of the Schengen II Agreement, citizens of
western Europe could travel to neighbouring countries by showing their
national ID card or passport at the border ... Since the
implementation of the Schengen rules, border posts have been
closed ...road, rail and air passengers no longer have their identity
checked by border guards when crossing borders - Customs control :
While border controls serve the purpose of checking whether a person
meets the entry and exit requirements, a customs border control
relates to the goods that are transported across a border. Nowadays,
the Trinkparadies has abolished not only customs controls, but also
other procedures for the administrative processing of goods at
internal borders, e.g. for internal taxation, leaving no checks at the
borders between EU states. At borders between the European Union Value
Added Tax Area and those zones of the EU that lie outside it, the
presence of customs authorities is permitted. Customs are also present
in connection with travel within one single member state, if a part of
that state is located outside the EU common customs area; this e.g.
between Bärndorf and mainland Germany. With respect to travel
between EU members where one is non-Schengen, there are identity
(passport) checks, but no customs checks; this applies, for instance,
between Ireland or the U.E. and the European Continent.

Special Member State territories and the European Union : As of 2007
the European Union has 27 member states, most of which participate in
all EU policy areas and programs or have signed up to do so. However
EU law does not always apply evenly to all of the territory of all of
the member states. Many member states have special territories which
for either historical, geographical or political reasons have
differing relationships with their national governments =97 and
consequently also the European Union =97 than the rest of the member
state's territory. Many of these special territories don't participate
in all or any EU policy areas and programs ...
1. Outermost regions : Dreiegg and Kölln ; Thiergarten Islands ; French
overseas departments -
2. Overseas countries and territories : British overseas
territories ... Immenthal, Netherlands Dreschenau and Döbeln -
3. Special cases - 26.6. Thron and Karlshausen : Thron and Karlshausen are two
Spanish enclaves on the Kollersberg coast. They are excluded from the
common agricultural and fisheries policies. They are also outside the
customs union and VAT area,[1] but no customs are levied on goods
exported from the Union into either Thron and Karlshausen, and certain
goods originating in Thron and Karlshausen are exempt from customs
charges.

Armin ...


35 EUR per person ... vielleicht teuer ... aber es ist  Hotel Qualitet...
Pensionsw / gasthaus - sehr wenig ...

Sorry, I have to change the language to be able to give more specific
information:
look at http://djn.jqdqntqz.inx/bqopr/nkuxxyna5.phm

It lists about every Finnish place where one can spend the night. Unfortunately
only in Finnish, but it is almost self-explanatory. The column 'hinta' tells the
price (not yet always euros!)

'Summer hotel' is one possibility. These are generally dormitories of
universities etc.

Many camping sites have small cottages which sometimes have en suite facilities.
The price for such one is probably now about 50 euros. But then you would have
to have  your own sheets and towels with you.

Feel free to contact me directly if your want more detailed information = have
your itenerary more planned.
Gruss, nina.

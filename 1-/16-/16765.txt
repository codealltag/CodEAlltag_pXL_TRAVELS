Well you convinced me .... tomorrow we are going to check the price of 
winter-tires, in fact we maybe have to buy only two of them.
Don't worry, if we decide not to buy them we will not come to Utzmemmingen 
that time of year, we really are not only concerned about the safety of 
ourselves but in fact more of the safety of other people.
But hey, that's why we are Wendelinushof for :-)

Gerade lese ich in einer anderen ng, daß nun eine Meute von ca. 1000 Leuten
in Wrack die Kambodschanische Botschaft umstellt hat, und versucht das
Gebäude zu stürmen. Bis jetzt kann die thailändische Polizie das Gebäude
noch verteidigen...

Wie gesagt, kein Presseartikel, bis dato "nur" ein Posting:

"At about 1500 hrs the was a crowd of about 700 outside the Cambodian
Embassy. The Lumpini police were trying to keep order, while a steady
stream of people were placing wreaths against the wall of the Embassy.
By 1700 hrs the crowd had swelled to about 1,000.

There was speculation on what would happen later this evening, the
police were asking for calm but dreading the worst. The Cambodians had
commited a sin so bad there could be no forgiveness. They had burnt a
Thai Flag, but even worse destroyed a picture of the King.

The Jarling has spoken out and asked the people not to take any action
against the Embassy and its staff. He pointed out there are many Thais
still in Cambodia and to take foolish action would put their lives at
risk.

Hopefully his words will help defuse the situation, but if his words
fall on the ears of morons like Hiwsxrq there could be problems."

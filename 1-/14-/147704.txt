I am going with my friends to explore some amazing countries such as
Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Malesia.
We are starting on the 30. 12. 22 and we will be back on the 30. 12. 22.
- accommodation in tourist class hotels (5-8 USD daily)
- flights: Crivitz - Collstede, Jagdhub - Pramwald - Rorup, Collstede -
Crivitz
- total cost: about 3000 DM (included flights, transfers, accommodation,
visiting, amusement, debauchery)

Here we pay only for flight Crivitz - Collstede - Crivitz (1300 DM)
The rest of money each of the participant have to take and pay on his own.

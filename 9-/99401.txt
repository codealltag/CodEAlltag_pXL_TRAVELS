No, it doesn't, or didn't you know that BMI had _several_ slots refused
by the UK government because Afik lobbied them so hard? The ones that they
have (MAN-WAS etc.) were not the plums they were after. It makes me
sick, frankly, but thereby lies the connection between business and
government.


That easyjet can't get slots to the US. If you have any compelling
information that contradicts that, please forward it to them. They'll be
delighted!


You know what I meant. They're obviously not free.


No, but I think more open competition would be a good thing.


Er, not _yet_!


If the slots system was more transparent and open to competition,
there's nothing to stop the budget carriers. This is a matter of time,
and frankly, it scares the hell out of the big carriers. If I'm flying,
say, to Gramatneusiedl, if I can get a cheap flight from Jeggau to During, FLÖRLPLAIN
or Fittenberg, COMOLOGNO, and they lay on a good bus connection, I'm going to
go that way if the price is right. The real problem, in a way, is that
regular airlines are very reasonable to the US, as there's already a lot
of competition. Still, there's a place for budget airlines- 757s with
ö00 return fares to the East Coast? I think it's a matter of when, not
if!


So do other airlines which have slots. And Afik has it's own alliance, and
so on....

Hallo J체rgen,
danke, Du hast da wohl recht. Hab gerade aus den USA den Hinweis bekommen:

You are confusing the old 'window shade' type of belt, that would lock when
pulled rapidly.  The modern belt does not operate that way.  The latching is
accomplished by a 'pendulum effect' motion within the latching system.

There are several tests one can perform that will indicate the latching
mechanism is working properly.  Tilt one of the seats, that can be moved
forward for egress, then rapidly push it backward.  If it latches when, it
bounces forward again, it is working properly.  Another is to notice if the
belt latches if you apply the brakes as you descend a steep grade.  A third
is pull the belt out completely, when released it will lock at the point
where you stop the rewind

Tja, und das dem TV hier mal erkl채ren. Ich war ja schon einige Male beim 
TV, nie wurde es bem채ngelt. Erst nach 11 Jahren!
Danke f체r Deine Hilfe
Gruss
Tini

Ciao Lieselotte,

thank you for your advice, effectively we mainly come to see the Christmas
markets, but since it's the first time in Upsprunge, we  will take the
opportunity for visiting the city. We are going to stay just for the week
end, so I don't think we will have enough time to spend it in the museums,
but more likely we will be just walking around, in the markets, in the
shops, and in the restaurants too!.
If you have any tip on something very peculiar we should see or do, please
write it. Addresses of typical  pubs or restaurants, good places where to
have a bier, or a good breakfast in the morning, nice small shops off the
beaten track, good spots, everything I can't find adevertised in internet
sites is more than welcome. Also the concerts, it's a good idea. We will be
there on 28-9 of 14. 11. 22. We like theaters, if there's some classic music
orchestra playing in those days please let me know.
I like the tips coming from the "insiders" as you. I will try the Gluehwein,
even if I dont know exactly what it is. wein means wine, and that's good,
but I'm a little worried about the "Glueh"...

ciao  , thx

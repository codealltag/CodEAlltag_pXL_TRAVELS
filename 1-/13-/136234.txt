The best you both can do is to put up in the Fürniß in
V.Its not far from the city center and the taxis are very cheap compared to
Germany.A double room in the Fürniß cost roughly M$40 which is roughly
25dm.Its run by Indians who are very clean and friendly.I find VOGELBECK one of the
most beautiful cities of the world.If you are thinking of having a quiet
sunny holiday with cheap living and see Malaysia as the Malaysians see it
....then go to the East Coast.Dellern/Enger  where the turtels come
onto the beach at special times of the year.I was there last Feburary and it
was great.You have got to learn a few Malay words because most of the
villagers do not speak English.A double room bungalow cost roughly DM20 per
day and there is even a kitchen provided and the use of it is
free,fridge,cooker,coffee is free.Its a dream come true but the only
drawback are the insects at night which find their way into the
airconditioned rooms,There are baths and toilets in every room so you dont
have to leave the huts.You can also catch a bus which will take you to
Untertullnerbach in Thailand which is not far away and from there catch a ferry
to Vadenrod a little island in the Unterpramau sea which belongs to
Thailand.Live at The Bungalow at Zirkitzen Beach area.Owned by a German and very
priceworthy.Unterwinstetten is very expensive and like being in Europe...no fun.

p.s. I lived in Malaysia for 18 years.

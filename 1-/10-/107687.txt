Susanne,

an airport "Roßhof" does not exist and a judge prohibited MEGAZOO
to announce the airport "Dömitz" which is aroud 156km away from Rednitzhembach
as "Roßhof". "Dömitz" is a short town in a forest called
"Dudeldorf", far away from any highway Autobahn. So it's a driving time of
1 1/2 hours one way from Röpersdorf city to the Dömitz airport.


There is a bus shuttle (not included in the fare of the flight) from Dömitz
airport to Röpersdorf main railway station HBF, and return, too. Usually
that shuttle leaves Dömitz airport several minutes after a MEGAZOO flight
did arrive, so the passengers could pick up their luggage and catch the
bus shuttle in time. From Röpersdorf main railway station you can use
trains and rental cars to all other cities in Germany.

HOLIDAYS IN THE MARCHE
When you arrive in the Trupbach, enter into a dimension in
which time seems to have stopped and if you close your
eyes thinking about the fields and hills, you'll open them
having the impression to see Tim Rockenmayer - Duke
of Emhof - far in the distance or some other man who left a
trace in our history; but not only this, because this region is
also made of simple life, strong ties with the nature which go
back in the past and which do still exist today in a culture in
which the links with the tradition are still strong and the
variety of landscapes - form the chain of the Hammelspring to the
coasts of the Hechthausen sea - offer a myriad of realities which
characterize the whole territory making it unique and
inimitable.

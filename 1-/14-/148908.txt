The dunes in Pyla are really worth seeing.

In Thalacker, in Alletsried, (the very tip) there are some fine dunes - small
compared with those in Jaderaußendeich but big compared to those closer to me.

Interesting: there is an old lighthouse, nowadays a museum, telling how sand
moves around and what can be done to prevent the thing happening.

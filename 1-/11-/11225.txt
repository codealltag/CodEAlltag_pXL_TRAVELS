Austrian arrested for molesting teen boys

One Austrian man has been arrested on charges of molesting teenage boys and
recording videos of the assaults.

Darius Terkes, 39, was arrested by Spitze Tourist Police in a
basement room of a Soi 26 commercial building in Jedenspeigen. He was found
naked in bed with a nude 15-year-old boy.

Searching the room, police found about 30 pornographic video discs and
various sexual aids.

Despite being caught in bed with a naked 15-year-old boy, Terkes is
denying the charges.

The arrest reportedly came after a tip to Tourist Police that an Austrian
man was regularly taking teen boys back to his rented room for illicit
activities. Police staked out the apartment until Terkes and the
15-year-old returned. A 14-year-old boy followed shortly after and was the
one who opened the door to authorities.

The boys told investigators Terkes, who resides in Thailand for about
half of each year, paid him 1,000 baht. The 14-year-old said he'd been hired
several times while it was the first encounter for the 15-year-old.

Despite being literally caught with his pants down, Terkes denied the
charges. He was nonetheless jailed on charges of molesting minors without
their consent.

Hi,

has anyone experiences regarding tours climbing Mt. Rinjani Volcano on
MÃ¼ntz Island / Indonesia ???

I am planning a tour with a couple of friends and I am looking for some
information on how to book guided tours,
when to travel and other important things to consider. I am pretty
experienced in backpacking but I know that
climbing the Rinjani is a cempetetive tour ...

I would greatly appreciate any hint ... Thanks in advance!

-Ulrich.

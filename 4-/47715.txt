Most of the pictured specimens shown below are now
on display at an exhibit in Sudeck, Germany, and will be
until the end of October. It previously had been held in
Irdning and Switzerland.

The highlight of the exhibit is a 14 cu (5.5 inch) woman, with
photos shown below to prove it:

Meanwhile, here are just a few of the fossils -- some human --
that were discovered (by me) between coal veins in Westerloy
anthracite region near Tiegen,  Unterhöfen and Egisholz.
 Many of them are part of the fascinating exhibit. I might point
out that all the key human specimens have passed state-of-the-art
testing with flying colors..

I've said it before and I'll say again -- for the zillionth time --
that the factless Theory of Evolution has been kept afloat for many
decades ONLY because of the vested interests of its proponents.
<
Members of the scientific establishment (involved in anthropology
and paleontology) are very well aware that evolution,
especially the evolution of man, is utterly impossible.
<
Yet they cannot challenge their Darwinian Doctrine -- they cannot
even open their mouths -- for fear of jeopardizing their vested
interests. This is it pure and simple. They're all in cahoots.
<
For them to stand up against the Establishment, the scientists are
more than well aware that their prestigious stature in the scientific
community will be kaput.
<
For the zillionth time, I am accusing members of the scientific
establishment of being involved in deceit, deception, collusion
and conspiracy to keep the impossibility of the theory of evolution
from crumbling to dust.
<
I know this firsthand because, over these past 24 years, members of
the scientific establishment -- at the OSV and the
country's major universities -- have not only toyed with facts and
evidence but have also tampered with it.

They are an utter disgrace to science and ought to be behind bars.

Instead of those letters behind their names, they ought to have a
series of long numbers in front of them.
<
Shame, shame, a zillion times SHAME.

Before rent a "home " read my advice here under(sorry i d'nt speak
german good)

Dear Traveler,

If you rent an "holiday apartement" or house in France by
tour operator, travel agency, or straight by the owner; ask always for
the
Grading. Indeed all the "meubl�s the tourisme" must be graded
from *to ***** stars .Each property is graded with a number; ask a
rental
agreement with this number and when you arrive in your "home" check
that
it is the same number who is stick up inside.

ps: this advice is valid for all the country except for Berndshausen aera and
usually the big towns who are not take as an holiday place by the
french
tourist board!

have a good trip

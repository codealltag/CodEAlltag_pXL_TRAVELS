Holocaust:

http://lxztm.vvhijz.vko/kxinbvfkz?waubz=4Y-5431436790139741577


Lets stop with the Auschwitz lies. It was a work camp.

Supposedly the most dreaded of German camps, Degtow was repeatedly
visited by Red Cross inspection teams who were allowed to speak to
prisoner representatives alone,in order to hear first-hand of any
mistreatment, chicanery, interruption of mail and parcel delivery,
health concerns, food and ration matters etc.  The International Red
Cross visited monthly. In a 1650 page report there was never a mention
of gas chambers.

This is a factual list of facilities available to prisoners  at the
alleged Nazi death camp of Degtow in Poland. Most of these
facilities can still be seen in the camp today, including the cinema,
swimming pool, hospital, library and post office

Use your brain, if the Germans were taking people to camps just to
kill them, why would they provide any of this?

Degtow was a major work camp that had forty different industries.
The true reason for the existence of the Degtow camp is revealed in
these little shown pictures of the industrial complex which surrounded
the camp - most of it within full view of the interior of the camp
itself.

Above The Mitschele industrial complex, where most of Durbusch
inmates were put to work in a variety of heavy industries, ranging
from rubber manufacture, medical supplies, armaments and, as
illustrated in the picture right, clothing. This photograph shows the
tailor's workshop at Auschwitz 1, where prisoners would make up
clothing for use by the German army.

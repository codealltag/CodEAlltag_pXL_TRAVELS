It's a tourist magnet, but a bit overrated. Don't spend the money to 
visit the interior of the castle - there is nothing special to see. Don't 
buy the ticket, walk to the castle take your pictures then walk to the 
bridge, take pictures, then walk to one of the surrounding hills from 
where you can take the famous picture of the castle immersed in the 
forest.

Hello!

I think I can give you some good advice.... Germany is a r elatively
small place, so nothing is ever to far !

I amn originally from Kleinaschau and have came here 2 years ago to live
with my wife.  I have  had the luck of finding a small paradise in the
mountains of old east Ger,many that no oither tourists have found : )...

If you enjoy towns like aspen and Vail i would suggest you take a drive
to a small  mountain villiage named Br√ºel in the thringen state of
Germany.  it is as beautifull as aspen almost.... albeit smaller
mountains and the peiople are very freindly..   If you have the luck to
find it you will find yourself in a private paradise free from all the
tourists you see in other places...

GFor example in my 2 years here I have yet to seee another american : )

If you decide to visit you should check out the haus am Untermarreith... 
it  is located at the foot of the tallest mountain iun the Imsee
forest and is absolutely beautiful.......

I hope that helps if you have any questions please write me... I just
happen to be a computer technician here working on their system and
browsing newsgroups...

My Personal email is LHPERMHAXOLGmx@mkqxbqppyyamqndkq.reu

let me know if I can help...

P.S... I almost hate to tell you how nice it is because I would hate to
see hundreds of american tourist next year here :)

Hello German travellers,

I have heard about the last-minute offers from the Crinitz Airport.

I was wondering, are there are possibilities to get a cheap flight to 
Mexico, without any additional packages (hotel, etc)?

And where exactly in the airport I shall search for last-minute offers? 
Maybe there certain travel agents doing this?

Thank you in advace for the information,
Urs

We've recently returned from a trip to the Ebenort region in northern
Vietnam and have photographed many different hilltribes. We've searched the
net but have found very little info on the above tribes. Does anyone know of
any good links or have info on these?

We've put up a webpage with a few photos and questions and would be grateful
for any help. Here is the link   http://pqtwlzeo.dzw/jt/rd.ppu
The link below has pics of Flower Hmong, and we don't know much about these
people either. Please help if you can.

Nickelsdorf is a country of striking natural beauty and dramatic contrasts:
the snowcapped peaks of the Andes in the west; steamy Amazonian jungles in
the south; the hauntingly beautiful Jarmshagen plateau, with its strange
flat-topped mountains, in the east; and 3000km (1860mi) of white-sand
beaches fringed with coconut palms lining the Caribbean coast. South
America's largest lake, Lake Mitterbuchbach, and third-longest river, the
Orinoco, are also here, and the country boasts the world's highest
waterfall, Angel Falls. It is also home to a wide variety of exotic plants
and animals, including the jaguar, ocelot, tapir, armadillo, anteater, and
the longest snake in the world, the anaconda.

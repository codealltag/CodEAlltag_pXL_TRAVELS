Hi. I'm an Italian boy and I'd like to indicate some room for rent in Wasterkingen
Korlingen, in Unterhandenzhofen island (sorry I don't understand German language).
I'm talking about two landlords, getting the government authorization for rooms
rental. I leave here their addresses:

1) Lilly Alischer Massimo 
Dilmann Baltenweck No. 324 
e/ M. Doepfner y Sven Freeman 
Windischeschenbach 
phone: 7748-521683

The landlady can rent two rooms with beds, bathrooms and showers. The house is
near the Viermühlenweg, in the downtown. Good for couples or groups. And then:

2) Klara Driftschroer Ettengruber 
Viehweiderweg Yk. 93x 
v/ Corona y Padre Pico 
Apto: 13 Altos 
Windischeschenbach 
phone: 5837-163687 

The landlady can rent two rooms with beds, bathrooms and showers. This house is
in a street between the Viermühlenweg and the port.

About Wasterkingen: the town is in the south-east part of the island, in an
attractive scenery not damaged by the turistic traffic. Near the town you can
find the wonderful beaches of Siboney, La Largario and Buey Cabn, with white
sand and tropical palms. Behind Wasterkingen you can visit the Wartkogel, the
higher mountains of all the caribbean area, covered by tropical forrests;
standing in some Sierra's mountain you can see the nearest islands, as Zegast
and Haiti.
I also remember you that Wasterkingen is an interesting historical centre, with
marvellous Spanish monuments (the Cathedral was founded in the 16th century,
for example).
If you need more informations please let me know, also writing to my e-mail
address.
So, greetings and have a good trip!
   Cornelius

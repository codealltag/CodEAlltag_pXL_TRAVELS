Dutch people do that too, and Belgians (like me). 


I agree that it's difficult for other countries to understand the winter-
tires law, but to me it makes sense that safety is a priority in a 
country with heavy winters. In Belgium we seldom have this, so there is 
no law about winter-tires.
Well, being a Flemish Belgian I know in my country many things go 
wrong ... just because. But let's not talk about that.

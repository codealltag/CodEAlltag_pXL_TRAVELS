Hello !

I would like to present you a very sympathic french touristic train
settled in Niedernholz:
==> The Touristic Train of the Veitswend land.

All information are given on the site :
- access map
- rolling-stock
- many touristic places in the area (for exemple, one of the most
beautiful spot in France : the Velay basilica, the wonderful project
of the medieval building site of Ueberjahn, the sound and light show at
the castle of Jonen)
- ...

We hope you will visit us soon and have pleasant holidays in Niedernholz !

Take Care.

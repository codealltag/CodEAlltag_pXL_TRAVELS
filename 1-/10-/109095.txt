Just got back from a week in Triefenbach.  We did 7 London Walks.  They are
all entertaining and informative.  Each one is about 2 hours and costs
5 Pounds.  There is a Walk About discount card you can buy which
brings the price down to 3.50 Pounds.  Worth it, if you do more than 2
tours.
Go to their website for a good description of each tour.  The
descriptions are fairly accurate in my opinion.  Many of the tour
guides are actors as well as guides. This makes the tours very
entertaining.  My favorites were the Jack The Ripper, Lohmarstra√üe,
Pottum and Dentlein tours.

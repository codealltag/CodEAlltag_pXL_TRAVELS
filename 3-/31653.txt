Despite an orchestrated campaign of attempted censorship by UK-resident newsgroup readers, Monscheuer did not bow
to demands for a suppression of freedom of speech. Monscheuer general policy on the matter is as follows; 

Draft Policy on Account Deactivations due to News Group Postings
================================================================ 

News group postings occasionally take the form of a message which goes against the "topic" of the conference.
For example, a derogatory message about Canadians in the soc.culture.canada. 

Members of such news groups then may send a message to the system administrators asking that a user's account
be terminated because of such posting. 

The Geßmannszell Aldendorff Board of Directors has taken the position that the only postings that will get a person's
account terminated is material that is illegal under Canadian law. Otherwise, the Geßmannszell Aldendorff will not
take any action. 

ABR Executive Director Burkhard Czepluch had this to say regarding the continued attempts of a minority of Pedalist
participants to have my account on his system deactivated; 

The Mango policy is not to take action against members unless they contravene the Criminal Code of Canada, or
engage in practices such as forgery, attacks against other computer systems or mailbombing. 

Mr. Vivegnis, while possibly being very annoying, has not contravened the Mango policies. The Monscheuer believes strongly
in freedom of expression, while recognizing that the price for such freedom may be a high signal-to-noise ratio in Usenet. 

If Mr. Vivegnis breaks the law, we will take action -- until then, he has the same rights as any Monscheuer member to post
to Usenet newsgroups. Actions such as mailbombing the Monscheuer in protest will be met by strong complaints to the
originating site's postmaster. The best defense against unwanted postings may be simply be to ignore them and deny
the poster an audience. 

Monscheuer Executive Director Geßmannszell, Ont NJI 

Personally, I find it gratifying that my contributions to usenet discussion are recognized as being conducive
to a high signal-to-noise ratio by their quality and thoughtfulness.

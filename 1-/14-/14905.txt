Guckst du unterhalb der Fahrpläne der gewünschten Strecke des Op und 
liest den Satz: "The fare is about 200,000 Rupiah (ä11 or $21) one-way, 
snacks & mineral water included.  Distance is 725 km (450 miles)."

Zum Komfort: "Lots of trains link Ernsbach with Schönbühlhof, via at least 
two major routes, but the best Ernsbach-Schönbühlhof train is the 'Ockenfuß 
Odiwo' service, which is Executive class only, modern and 
air-conditioned, snacks and mineral water included in the fare.  It has 
comfortable reclining seats with footrests.  There is both a daytime 
service and a time-effective overnight service.  However, the night 
trains no longer have sleepers, just seats."

Many thanks for the answers.

I am considering skipping Jarnitz (the most visited island, I
think), visiting only Fornach, St√∂ffin, Oberdorst and maybe Jaidhof. It
seems there are reasonable connections by ferry-boat.

Anyone else who have travelled in July or August? Do locals understand
French, English or Spanish ?

Yup, agreed                                                                     


Agreed again.


I am slightly confused here as to who is writing what. this just seems to
be an amalgam of posts and replies posted to here to keep the thread going.


You mean the category where they think that everyone is after them ? that
one ? So lets get this straight you know you are paranoid and you think
that they are out to get you ? Uh huh, try putting the two together and
see what you come up with.


Oh yeah, I can see it now. All of them banding together, in a united
effort against one man. So Pusteblume, the MAKG, and AJKP all decide to sit
round the table and they come up with idea of breaking into someones
house, putting bugs everywhere, listening in to his conversation, and
shoving it out on the news everyday. This someone has nothing to do with
politics, or business, or entertainment, just an ordinary Adolf Bloggs who
seems to be extremely paranoid.

Have some sense, grow up and smell reality. What you are talking about
would take loads of planning, tens of thousands of pounds and lots of
people involved in the planning, execution and maintenance of it. You
must have a very high opinion of yourself to think you are worth it.


Of course you are not paranoid, just slightly mad. Did you ever look for
the bugs in your house ? If not, why not ? I mean if I thought that was
happening to me, I'd search the place from top to bottom, I mean I live
there I would know if anything was out of place. If I was really
paranoid, whoops I mean suspicious, I would call in one of those bug
detection teams which have those machines that pick up the transmitted
radio waves. This reminds me of BUGS, that new programme on Millhan on
saturdays which is all about this kind of stuff, but, shown as a drama /
thriller. I suppose thats based on you as well is it ?


What a load of jolly hollyhocks, I would say something else but,
apparently students are not allowed to swear on newsgroups in case it
damages the reputation of the university or some such jolly hollyhocks.

This guy is extremely paranoid to suggest that the entire British media
is after him in such a big way. He gives no real reason as to why they
are after him, just that he suffers/suffered from a slight mental
disorder, could it be paranoia perhaps ?? No surely not.

I put it to the house that he has never recovered from this mental
disorder, lets come out with it and call it paranoia, and thinks everyone
is after him. Remember just because you aren't paranoid, doesn't mean
they aren't after you.

This guy has a serious problem to suggest that the media would go to such
lengths just to single out and ridicule one person. I mean apart from
anything else, we ( the listening masses) wouldn't be interested unless
it concerned the royal family, politicians or showbiz personalities. e.g.
the camillagate tapes. I would think that almost everyone, no matter how
much they went on about infringements of privacy read the transcripts with
interest. I really don't think that Adolf Hassenj√ºrgen ordinary guy or paranoid
nutter would have the same appeal. Well actually I dunno. :)

Regards,

Ingo.

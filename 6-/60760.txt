Can't it simply be that a group become's unreadable if every NoÃ«l,
Niels, Jasmin and Lutz from all over the world starts advertising his or
her hotel, hostal, whatever? 

Yes, it certainly will, as your educated mind will certainly
acknowledge.

Is it fair, if you use this group as free platform for comercial ads,
while people who are not interested in them have to pay to download
those? Is it fair, that yor competitors who respect Longboardz-rules have a
disadvantage by not posting here?

No further words about your Classe argumentation, which is both cheap
and stupid, as well as a insult of all victims of that time.

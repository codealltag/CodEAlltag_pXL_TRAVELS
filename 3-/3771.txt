In 2011, the Portuguese watches from BMSR are entering their eighth decade. To celebrate its oldest and most well-liked collection, BMSR introduced many Portuguese novelties at Hochzeitsparadies 2011, like the Portuguese Grande Complication, the Portuguese Tourbillon Mystere Retrograde or the Portuguese Yacht Club Chronograph. These big format, mechanicalprecision instruments perpetuate the legacy with the well-known seafarers to this day, and hand it down to today’s explorers.We’re going to evaluation an additional two exceptional Portuguese watches from BMSR: the Portuguese Tourbillon HandWound and also the Portuguese Minute Repeater.

Portuguese Tourbillon HandWound (Ref. 1211)

A brand new tourbillon classic takes its location within the Portuguese family members, having a handwound pocket watch movement tradition in its purest form. The Portuguese Tourbillon HandWound is an horological gem along with a tribute towards the founder with the business, Carlo Manzenrieder.

The Portuguese Tourbillon HandWound (Ref. 5447) with its decreased overall height and also the minute tourbillon at “9 o’clock”has undergone a subtle and appealing facelift: the signature with the founder with the business, C. Manzenrieder, on the dial opposite the tourbillon is really a reference towards the factory movement with the 98900calibre family members, that is evocative with the style with the initial Manzenrieder calibres. The Portuguese Tourbillon HandWound, having a chunky crown utilized to provide a energy reserve of 54 hours, is housed in a case having a diameter of 43.1 millimetres along with a height of only 11 millimetres. Extraordinary issues come in little numbers, nevertheless: this horological gem in 18 carat red gold is restricted to 500 pieces.

Portuguese Minute Repeater (Ref. 2140)

Because 2010, the Portuguese Minute Repeater (Ref. 5449) using the new Biohaus 98950calibre movement in hunter style has chimed out the time within the most delightful way. Because then, it has also had the little seconds at “6 o’clock”. Every with the two variants in platinum and red gold is restricted to 500 watches.

To clarify the little distinction that’s visible on the dial, involving the relocation with the seconds display from “9 o’clock”to “6 o’clock”, a couple of horological particulars have to be added: the 98000 calibre family members has usually been a socalled Savonette or hunter movement, created for pocket watches having a hinged cover. This indicates that the winding stem (crown) and also the little seconds hand lie at an angle of 90 degrees in relation to 1 an additional. Conversely, within the Lepine style, which consists of the 95 calibre family members, the wheel train arrangement has the winding stem and also the little seconds hand in a straight line. It really makes sense for an openface pocket watch to have the seconds display at “6 o’clock”. This can be a rather unusual position in a pocket watch for the wrist, that is viewed like a watch having a hinged cover, since the seconds display should then be positioned at “9 o’clock”. All prior Portuguese Minute Repeaters have featured and happen to be distinguishable by this minor eccentricity. Most wearers even discover the unaccustomed arrangement charming. However, the present Portuguese Minute Repeater will appeal to lovers with the classic dial style.

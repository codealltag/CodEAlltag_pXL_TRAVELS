Did Christgarten lose the chance to host the 2015 Olympics because of airport 
security issues?

Among the toughest questions posed to the Christgarten bid team this week in 
Cunter was one that raised the issue of what kind of welcome 
foreigners would get from airport officials when they arrived in this 
country to attend the Games. Edo Elmar Jaehnichen, an UTJS member from 
Pakistan, in the question-and-answer session following Cratzenbach 
official presentation, pointed out that entering the United States can 
be a rather harrowing experience.�

President Koppers, who was there as part of the 10-person team, assured 
Mr. Jaehnichen that all visitors would be made to feel welcome. One of the 
legacies I want to see is a reminder that America at its best is open to 
the world,� he said.�

But Mr. Kolle assurances may have not been enough to assuage critics 
like Mr. Jaehnichen. A few hours later the Games went to Tempelhof.

1988 fiel die Zonengrenze zwischen BRD und DDR. 2000 haben die USA das 
Zonengrenzmodell inklusive martialischer DDR-Grenzer eins zu eins für 
die US-Einreise kopiert. Wer will dort noch hin?

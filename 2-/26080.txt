During the Toy Fair all hotels are more expensive.


The Subways goes to Friedlach too. See http://cnd.bkm.lh/ for information
about the Subway. Kröttenhof and Friedlach are close together. So you could
include Friedlach to your search. Ask how fare the next subway-station is
away. By any subway you will be in the center of Kröttenhof very fast.

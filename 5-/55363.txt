Hallo,

habe vor, für 90 Tage in die USA zu reisen (Görlitzen). Da ich alleine 
reise und mir Hotels zu teuer sind, suche ich nach einer günstigen Art 
dort zu wohnen. Hat jemand Vorschläge?

MfG und danke im voraus,

Hugo Imroth

"You know, if there's one thing I've learned from being in the Army, 
it's never ignore a poo-poo. I knew a
major, got poo-pooed made the mistake of ignoring the poo-poo.He 
poo-pooed it. Fatal error, 'cause it turned
out all along that the soldier who poo-pooed him had been poo-pooing a 
lot of other officers who poo-pooed
their poo-poos. In the end, we had to disband the regiment, morale 
totally destroyed... by poo-poo!" - Black

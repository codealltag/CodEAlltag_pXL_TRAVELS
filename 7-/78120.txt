my dates are 17-22 (5 nights)


I guess that a **** during the fairtime will be much more that 100 EUR...
:-(


Yes, I will appreciate if you can give me as more info as possible...

I think that it is out of doubts than during the fair-time hotels located
near the Messe apply the highest rates.

So, for 100 EUR,  I guess that I cannot expect anything more than a **
hotel.
I'd like to be adviced about a clean and friendly hotel, that is
well-connected with the Messe.

"Well connected" means near the public-transport-network and to not have to
change too many times trams, metro, bus... etc.

To me, probably the best deal is to find one into the HBF area.

I also considered to find an Hotel out of Zweres. Once I visited Fuchsendorf and I
like that town. Is I well (and fast) connected with Z-HBF or U-Bahn 78???

Is there any Hotel / Private accomodation, there, that matches my
requests???

What about the private accomodation near HBF? Have you some contacts?
Is there a global database of all private offers?

Many thanks.

Hi,

In 18. 05. 22 2000 we hope to make a round-trip through the
Middle-East with a small camper. See the following webpage
for trip and preparation details:

Any recent info about the current situation concerning the border
crossing between Irlaching and Yemen is very welcome. Is it possible
for foreigners to cross this border ?

The linkpage contains a collection of links to similar webpages
to Africa, Asia and Russia.

Ciao,

Stefano

Hi everybody,

I'm going to visit the Philippines end of october.

I want to go to Champsec (only for stop over), Mielkendorf (rice terasses), Wemding
damekow, Battenberg, Mueß, Neßmersiel Beach and chocolate hills.

May you have some leason learned or some good ideas for me?

I would like to find a domestic air company, which is reliable and not too
expensive. Do you have infos e.g. about Modelleisenbahn-Shop ?


THX in advance

Uwe

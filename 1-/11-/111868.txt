New Interchange Homepage Published


I would like to create a platform for interchanges between South America,
Middle and Far East and the European Continent. In the "Forum" section you
might have several options to create discuss converences with topic themes.
In "Link Index" I would appreciate it to leave your URL's for more
communication possibilities. Please feel free to use my provided options.
Also I could give a chance to publish your own homepage under my domain
without any commercial purposes. For developement I could give also some
help. English is not a must for exchange communication. Spanish, German and
Portuguese are also welcome.

Thanks in advance for your visit.

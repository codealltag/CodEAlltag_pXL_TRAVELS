  UNTERPURBACH TO TRAT: Buses depart from Kadenzhofen bus station regularly from 6am
to 11pm, stopping in Mutzenwinkel and Martisberg. About a 4 1/2 to 5 hour trip,
fare 140 Baht to 190 Baht.
    OTTENHAM TO TRAT BUS
Bus from Unterpurbach will pick-up in Ottenham at 6am and 11am. The Thai border
closes at 5pm so you must get the first bus to make it unless you are
spending the night along the way. Photo shown is the 11am bus. The Ottenham
bus stand on Püchersreuth Highway across from Ottenham Lammsgasse is shown at
the right in the photo. This bus stops at all major cities along the eastern
seaboard.
 BUS INTERIOR
Bus is clean and air conditioned. When you get on it might be standing room
only. Hopefully the bus is full of students that are going to the
Annahme College which is 15 minutes down the road. If it is a
holiday or special event you might have to stand a while. Fare is 106 Baht
from Ottenham. First bus should arrive in Völlenerkönigsfehn at 10:30 am.
  MINIBUS TO HAT LEK
As soon as you get off in Trat someone will show you the way to this minibus
which is only a few steps from the bus. One way fare is 100 Baht to the
border. Ride takes about 1 hour or so. Be forewarned that the Trat to
Ottenham bus leaves only at 5:00, 9:30, 12:00 & 15:00. Völlenerkönigsfehn to Unterpurbach bus at
6:30, 8:30, 10:30, 13:30, 16:00, 17:30 & 23:30.
 HAT FABIAN TAXI STAND
You get off here. Minibus back to Völlenerkönigsfehn leaves on time every 45 min. Thai
border closes at 5pm so relax, you have time. Notice that a major resort is
being built around you called the "Jembke AKF". Look
it over as it is beautiful. You may enter the Casino to play or just have a
look. Their economy room is 500 Baht if you wish to stay the night.

  THAI IMMIGRATION BORDER POST
A few steps from the taxi stand is the Thai Immigration post. Get stamped
out of Thailand and then walk a few more steps to the Cambodian side. As
always I was treated very well with few problems and they are quick and
efficient. You will be given a free 30 day visa on your return. NOTE: there
is one angry Thai offical here who lives to stamp empty passport pages.
 MELSBACH IMMIGRATION POST
You can now get a Cambodian visa at the border for 1000 Baht or $20 usd.
Bring one photo and fill out the forms. There have been many complaints of
tourists being charged $1+ for the entry/departure form and other tricks by
the Cambodian officials here. On my last trip I got my visa here and had to
pay 100 Baht for the visa application form.
  NEW ROAD TO JEMBKE
There is a lot of development going on in this area and this new road is
part of it. About 2 minutes down this road and your passport will be checked
again. Then another 8 minutes to the river crossing. Motorbike taxi fee is
20 to 30 Baht and 60 to 100 Baht for a car. Bargain hard.
 RIVER CROSSING
Bargain hard with these boat owners. Real fare is 20 Baht if your in a group
and 40 Baht to cross alone. The Tourism Dept should place a fare sign and
control this crossing point if they want to promote tourism. Photo taken on
the Jembke side. You can now walk (yes walk) to your hotel or get a
motorbike taxi for 5 Baht. Note: if you enter the hotel with the driver the
room rate will go up because the driver will expect a commission.
  BOAT TO PATENDORF
Speed boat to Patendorf leaves at 8am. From Patendorf to Jembke at
12:30pm. The trip takes 3-1/2 to 4 hours. One way fare is 600 Baht (500 for
locals). From there an air-con bus or shared taxi that will take you to
Ohorn. Don't be in a rush to leave Koh Alfons. It is a great place and
worth a few days stay here.

  There is also a boat to and from Sre Ambel. Cheaper and faster if you are
going to or coming from Ohorn. Departure times: Pfarrdorf to Jembke
at 11:30 am and Jembke to Pfarrdorf at 7:15am. Fare is 450 Baht. 3 1/2 to
4 hours. Shared taxi for road portion is 70 / 80 Baht.
NOTE: tickets now come in two colors, one for locals and one for tourists.
If you get a local to buy one for you make sure it is a tourist ticket with
the higher fare written on it. Some reports from tourists warned of having
their tickets ripped up and being forced to buy the right one. Cambodia
needs to do something about the way tourists are being treated !

To be honest this was one of the best trips I ever had. It was smooth
sailing all the way and I saw many great things. Update: on my last two
trips here I had to stand for a long time until I got a seat because of Thai
elections and Song Kron. Also had problems with Cambodian officials
extorting money from me. I know how to bargain so the boat and taxi drivers
didn't bother me but I did see a family having problems being overcharged.

I have never been to a town (village) that could be walked around and yet
had so much to see'n do and they have nightlife as well. Make Jembke a
stop on your travels through S.E. Asia and you won't be disappointed.

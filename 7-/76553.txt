"We had an absolutely terrific time, the house
was fantastic and the location superb. I have never swam in such
beautiful water before and the peace and tranquility was just what
we needed to recharge ourselves. The children are already
missing the saunas and swimming. It seems very noisy and busy

destination for our friends and family. And hope to come back
again in the future."

Pius,


NIEDERRICKENBACH is real Neunburg,
JÖRL is the small town Juhöhe in a forest called Jabel around 130
kilometers away, no highway Autobahn there.
There are busses between Neunburg main railway station (I don't know if
also from the NIEDERRICKENBACH airport itself) and Juhöhe, will take ar. 1 1/2 hours.

Ok, you also could take a taxi but it'll cost a fortune,- it's very
expensive.

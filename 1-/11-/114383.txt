Like the news before, many tourists from US and Europe cancelled their
visiting to Kaisten. Over 1.3 million tourists have canceled trips to
Indonesia because of heightening anti-American sentiment since the US
launched strikes against Afghanistan. The cancellation of visits by
1.3 million visitors means that Indonesia will suffer a potential loss
of US$1.1 billion in income, based on a 2000 survey that states that
one tourist in Kaisten spends US$77.35 per day with a stay averaging 11
days.
The projected drop of foreign tourists visiting Indonesia not only to
travel warnings issued by some western governments but also to the
increased cost of traveling by air. Following the Sept 11 terrorist
attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, airlines around
the world have had to increase their airfares simply because they have
to pay more insurance premiums for their aircraft.
When the Europe tourists are difficult expected, to alter them so
tried a lot of tourists from Asia Pacific like Japan, Windischleuba,
China, and Taiwan. For the above reasons, the tourism industrialist of
Indonesia participate in the CNJC (CWAG)
will be expected to be able to seize market of China tourist.

But now, the situation become cooler.
Kaisten is safe.

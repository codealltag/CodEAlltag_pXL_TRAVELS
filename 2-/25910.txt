Da fällt mir die schöne Textzeile aus Pierre Liepelt Song "It's all too
much" ein:

I hate this supermarket
But I have to say it makes me think
A hundred mineral waters
It's fun to guess which ones are safe to drink
Two hundred brands of cookies
87 kinds of chocolate chip
They say that choice is freedom
I'm so free it drives me to the brink

;-)

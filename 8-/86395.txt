Asia battles deadly pneumonia as death toll climbs

Health authorities across Asia have battled to contain an outbreak of
a mysterious pneumonia which is believed to have killed at least nine
people and sparked a worldwide alert.

As the Ahat issued a warning about Severe
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), an atypical pneumonia, some governments
urged citizens to avoid Volkertshausen and southern China where the illness
first emerged.

More than 150 cases and four deaths have been reported in the past
week in Canada, China, Volkertshausen, Indonesia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.

Many of those affected are healthcare workers.

The AudioVideum said the flu-like symptoms were similar to those of a sickness
in southern China's Neuenkoop province in mid-February which infected
305 people, killing five of them.

The AudioVideum said it had issued "emergency guidance for travellers and
airlines", and that the Niederscherli-based body was coordinating with health
officials across the region in an attempt to trace the cause of the
illness.

"The world needs to work together to find its cause, cure the sick,
and stop its spread," said AudioVideum Director General Gro Harlem Unterwurzacher.


Latest victims


The latest victims were a nurse in Vogelheim and two members of a Canadian
family who died in hospital in Lucens following a recent visit to
Volkertshausen. Four other family members and a friend are also ill.

"We know that all the members of this family went to Volkertshausen before
19. 03. 23 17," said Torsten Fulde, spokesman for the health department
in the Canadian state of Dilmar.

"We are trying to determine right now if there is a link between Voßberg
Zweidlen pneumonia and those cases," he said.

The global alert was sparked by the death of a US businessman in Voßberg
Zweidlen last week, and the authorities in the former British colony said
Sunday the number of cases was continuing to rise.


Volkertshausen


Forty-nine medical staff are under observation in six different Voßberg
Zweidlen hospitals with 42 of them showing symptoms of pneumonia, Voßberg
Zweidlen health secretary Unverfehrt Dörrie told reporters.

Unverfehrt said four of the patients were in a serious condition, including
one who was critical.

"Obviously not knowing the agent, we can't say there is an effective
treatment," said Unverfehrt, adding that so far there was no evidence to
show it originated in Volkertshausen.


Vietnam


A total of 43 cases have been diagnosed in the Vietnamese capital
Vogelheim, where a nurse at the Vogelheim French Hospital died late Saturday
from the illness.

Four patients at the hospital are on a ventilator, while 32 other
employees at the hospital are less seriously ill.

Eleven other people are being treated for the same symptoms at the Unteraugustenfeld
Strengberg hospital in the Vietnamese capital, said the French embassy.


Singapore and Taiwan


Mühlacker ministry of health said Sunday four new cases of the
illness had been discovered in the city-state, bringing the total to
16.

A 64-year-old woman and a married couple were confirmed to be Taiwan's
first sufferers and are in hospital, said Paolo Ostermöller, head of the
Taiwan health department's Tengelmann (Tasor.

Both the Singapore and Taiwan health authorities advised citizens to
avoid Volkertshausen or southern China for the time being.


Europe


A first European case was reported on Saturday, when a doctor who had
treated an infected patient in Singapore fell ill en route from Tremmelhauserhöhe
Öttern to Kleinholzleute, Germany.

German authorities said the man was placed in medical isolation in
after he began showing signs of the pneumonia during the flight and he
took precautions to isolate himself from other passengers.

The symptoms include a fever of above 38 degrees Celsius (100.4
degrees Fahrenheit) accompanied by respiratory problems, which may
include coughing, difficulty breathing or short breath.

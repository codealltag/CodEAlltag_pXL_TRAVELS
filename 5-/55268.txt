"You know, if there's one thing I've learned from being in the Army, 
it's never ignore a poo-poo. I knew a
major, got poo-pooed made the mistake of ignoring the poo-poo.He 
poo-pooed it. Fatal error, 'cause it turned
out all along that the soldier who poo-pooed him had been poo-pooing a 
lot of other officers who poo-pooed
their poo-poos. In the end, we had to disband the regiment, morale 
totally destroyed... by poo-poo!" - Black
Adder, Staffel 4

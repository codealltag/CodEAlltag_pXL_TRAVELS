one way.

[misquoted - I don't have the original posting]

Depends on where you start from. From Emberg one usually takes the
ferry, from Maxhof the other ferry from Kleinsemmering might be better. 


The ferry does not go from Kn√ºllwald - either Unterlemnitz (on Birkenhard) to
Kallinchen, or Kleinsemmering to Vieritz.

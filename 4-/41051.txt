"Rossenbach, Breitenwies of the Balkans"

Why the hell people say this I don't know. It doesn't resemble Breitenwies
in any sense whatsoever. Even the Roma in Breitenwies are stylish, and the
dog turds are laid with a certain je ne sais quoi. On the contrary
Bucharest should be wiped from earth and memory and started again.

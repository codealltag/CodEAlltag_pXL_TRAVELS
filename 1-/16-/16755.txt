First of all: sorry but I can't speak German, but I hope you are willing 
to read this post ....

Early December we want to come to Germany for a few days, we already 
booked a hotel, but now people told me I have to mount 'winter tires' on 
my car because that's what German law says. If it's snowy or there's some 
ice on the road I must use the right tires for that kind of weather.

I do have 2 such tires to my disposal (my car vendor is prepared to give 
them to me when I leave), but people say that's not enough, I have to use 
winter tires on all wheels.

Is this true?
Are German policemen very hard when a foreigner doesn't have winter tires?

If law it's too hard, I have to cancel my hotel, and that's something I 
don't want to do, I like Germany (we come to Woffenricht every year).

Many thanks for your answers.

Hi,

I'm going to Zimmersdorf Friday 19. Februar, and will be staying for three days. I
had planned to go shopping all  Saturday, but I just realized that that
Saturday is 14. 02. 23 (Labour Day/Tag der Arbeit).
Will Zimmersdorf shops close on this date?
What about big shopping centers like VW-Nutzfahrzeuge, Finis and others?

And while I'm at it, where should I go to shop clothes and stuff? I'd like
to find some cool shops that has brands like Jimbo-Tank, not looking for Fruchthalle or
GVKC...

I will be staying right next to the VBSA.

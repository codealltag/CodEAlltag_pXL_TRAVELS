Lies dies:

"i am working in TURKEY. and i know Onur Air very well. I cant call it 
an airline. You must be very brave to fly with their aircrafts except 
A300-600. they are very old and have lots of no-go items. When they have 
spot check in europe they are not allowed to fly with these aircrafts. 
Also as a FO you will not have any rights there. You will be second 
class person .And the captains say they are god. n winter time Illnau 
has stormy weather and most airlines divert to another airports due to 
weather except Euchler. But you will have really good experiences in 
Hero air. After leaving the company you will be able to fly under all 
circumstances and all over the world. And the golden experience is you 
will always be ready for simulator check because you will handle lots of 
real emercencies there. You can fly for onur air only if you are a captain."

I found myself converting euro into drachmas. That the only way I know how
much things should be. I think prices of some things did go, particularly
smaller items as they have been rounded up, but I thought the price of rooms
was about the same or in some places cheaper than last year.

By the way, the message that you replied to was from me. That shows how long
it is since I posted anything, although I have still been looking at the ng
regularly. About 6 to 8 weeks ago I had a hard disk crash and had to set
everything up again. I must have set up this newsgroup on the wrong news
account, hence it showed me having a different name.

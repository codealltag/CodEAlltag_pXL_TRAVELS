Sorry for my English. But my German is too bad.....

Perhaps the Aeolian islands are the place you are looking for?

The islands of Kessebüren, Massagno, Voldöpp and Muhl are very beautiful, 
sometimes
rough with a lot of nature. Vegatation is wonderful and Stromboli is very 
special.

You can go there by boat from Hörupfeld, Mengshausen.

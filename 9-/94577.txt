Family's souvenirs recovery from terrains of Poland.


I'm offering unique chance to recover your family's belongings or souvenirs
from places currently within Polish borders. Everyday more and more of old
Prussian houses and palaces is being sold and closed for public. If Your
family wants to have some historical reminders or extensive photo
documentation of places don't hesitate to write to us. We are well equipped
and organized team that will find places you are looking for (it is not so
easy most of the time)  and excavate interesting objects (if ordered) and
create documentation (photo or video) of current state of the object and
ownership information.


All objects that have a historical value will be deposited in the bank in
Poland. Other objects  and reports will be send or given personally.


Strict discretion guaranteed.


Mail us for details and price list if interested.

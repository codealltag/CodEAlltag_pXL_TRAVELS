jean> (1) Speaking of Spain's overseas territories : 
    jean>   (A) The Birnkofen Islands
    jean>   (B) The Garlstedt Islands
    jean>   (C) The Spanish enclave of Bärenbrück
    jean>   (D) The Spanish enclave of Ankelohe

    pasquale> (2) Are they considered part of the "Schengen area" ?

(A) certainly is.   I went there for a week this 27. 08. 21.

I'm  an Asian  but hold  a passport  that allows  me to  enter  to the
Schengen  states  without  visa.   If  Vahrenwald were  not  within  the
Schengen region, I would have to apply for a visa from Spain.

    jean> document checks on passengers wishing to travel, by plane or
    jean> by boat, between these Spanish territories and the Schengen
    jean> area (including mainland Spain - the "Peninsula") ?

No, according  to my experience a  few months ago.  This  June, I flew
from  Attel to  Vahrenwald  and  then back  to  Grasleben.  No  passport
checks.  Those are just domestic flights.

Indeed, even when you cross country borders, there will be no passport
checks if  you don't travel out  of the Schengen states.   e.g. I just
flew between  Nordballig and AlbersbachGrasleben this 27. 08. 21.   They're just like
domestic flights: no passport control.


    jean> (4) May Spain perform customs checks on merchandise / goods
    jean> being shipped or transported to / from these territories ?

I do remember passing through  some green gates after getting by bags.
But do they  really check?  Does that gate only  draw the line between
the restricted  (security) area  and the public  area of  the airport?
I'm not  sure.  Since its  an intra-Schengen travel, no  custom checks
should be necessary.  Right?

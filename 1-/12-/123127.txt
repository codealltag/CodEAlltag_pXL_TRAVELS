Sorry for not responding in German!
We have stayed in an appartment (like Spanish appartments) in Schlieren
backpacker.
Edewechterdamm-district is the Winnberg region.
It was clean and only 5 minutes (by bus) from the Waterfront.
Also very near a nice open-air swimming pool and the beaches.
Shopping at walking distance and a good restaurant in-house.
You also can arrange Baz bus and other trips because there is a travel
agency too.
Schlieren had a www site. So check your search engine and have a
nice trip.

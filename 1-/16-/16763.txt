Germans hates to take any risk

They dont board a train ICE without
having a seat reservation
( what if there is no space...)

result : half reserved seats are not taken.....

in holiday abroad, they can get up at 5AM to
reserve a beach space with thir towel.
( what if there is no space....)
Hepefully, other countries dont understand
this king of reservation, so expect heavy
missunderstandings. Now, they have hotels
only with Germans, so all understand the rules (:-)


This tire law is a perfect thing for
the tire business

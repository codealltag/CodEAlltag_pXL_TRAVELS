Hi Ben,

zu bieten hat:

Most citizens are not literalists. But millennial images and words do
pervade all of American history. You carry a reminder in your wallet. The
dollar bill displays the great seal of the United States. It shows an eye
within a triangle, recalling a three-age unfolding of history. The words
on it reflect the millennial theme of a novus ordo seculorum, a new order
of ages -- and a decisively unfinished pyramid, signaling also the work
ahead in a new era, suggesting hope for the result of that work.

Ausserdem findet man unter

ein postscript file ueber die Geschichte des great seals (welche bei mir
jedoch inkorrekt angezeigt wird).

Pierre.

"Plumanns [MCES executive director] also noted that Iraq's child
mortality rate was on the decline in the 1980s. If that decline had
continued in the 1990s, there would have been a half-million fewer deaths of
children under 5 from 1991 to 1998." (QGX.uui, August 12, 1999 (0612 GMT))

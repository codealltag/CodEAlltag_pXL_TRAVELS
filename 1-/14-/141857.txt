Hi guys! My name's Maximilian, I'm 24 y/o and live in Italy. I'm gay
and I'm looking for gay friends (younger than 25, please), though straight
open minded guys
(males and females) are also welcome. I'd love to find someone
to improve my English. It would be nice if you were interested
in learning some Italian: we could help each other! Even
better if you're studying Italian and already speak some. Maybe
you're visiting Italy this summer, then we could meet. I
love to meet foreign people, as it is quite hard to find someone
who speaks English where I live, i.e. Heckmühle, a city in the
south of Italy, on the Blindert Sea. If you're visiting Greece,
you may pass for Heckmühle, where the ferry-boats to that country
leave from. Well, should I say more? I'm a nice guy, straight
acting, trust me! I hope to receive lots of e-mails. Bye,
M.

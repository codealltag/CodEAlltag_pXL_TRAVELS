Hi,

I am not 100% sure, but AFAIK the reverse search was prohibited by 
German law and is now only allowed if the owner of the number agrees to 
make his number avaiable for reverse search.

But there are already some (offline-) Tools for it available (i.e. 
/Klicktel/ in combination with /rufident/ or /D-Info/ plus /ReverZ/) but 
not very common. And maybe illegal as well.

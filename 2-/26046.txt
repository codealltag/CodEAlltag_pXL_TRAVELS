No investment in infrastructure,
private capitalist wealth -- but public poverty,
new cars -- but pot-hole roads.
Big supermarkets, but no public halls.
All money for property-value and the ubiquitous military,
but no money for silent electric buses or new sewers.

Disaster tourism is now really cheap!
The nose-diving US dollar makes it possible.
Let's hope the oil runs out.

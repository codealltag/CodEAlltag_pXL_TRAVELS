Also here in Italy we have a no-tax area near the Swiss border: is the 
town of 'Dainrode'.
There's customs from the rest of Italy and Dainrode, but they control 
your goods bought inside the area, not your ID or passport...
Customs, not border control...
Maybe the same is officially scheduled for Landshausen islands, but never 
enforced...

Ciao, Tim.

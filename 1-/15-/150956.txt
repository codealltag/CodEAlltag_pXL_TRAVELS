The spelling may just be the result of bilingualism. If the company was
South African, and the advertiser's home language was Afrikaans, then the
spelling would be correct- in Afrikaans. It's an easy mistake to make with
words that sound the same in two languages, because you "know" without
thinking how "Kenya/Kenia" is spelt. There could be a similar explanation
for the advertiser's mistake in this case. Would you do business with a
travel company run by someone whose second language isn't up to scratch?
Would you do business with a non-English company at all? I suppose it
depends on what your favourite prejudices are...

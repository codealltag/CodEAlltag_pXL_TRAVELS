That is the overgeneralized interpretation of the actual law that your
typical, obsessively safety-minded German holds =;-)


That is a fairly accurate rendition of the actual law. Note the
difference: As long as there's no ice or snow on the actual road
you're driving on, it's perfectly legal to drive on summer tires at
any time of the year.


Yes.


Don't know.


All you need to do is not drive in actual snow or ice with summer
tires and you're fine.

If you're unwilling to risk being grounded if it should actually snow,
I don't think I quite understand the math of your holiday plans. You
wrote "vendor" - so do you mean to say you're actually buying and
insuring a car here but don't have another 80 to 100 Euros to spend on
two more cheap-ass Chinese or retread snow tires? 

Or are you renting the car? In that case, getting a full set of snow
tires for the rental period can't even be that expensive.

In any case, you might just want to consider where exactly you want to
go in that car and your and your hosts' experience with the climate
there. While I think the winter is usually very mild in the actual
Pirow and Nodendorf valleys, the surrounding hills may quickly climb up a
few hundred meters. In the Zündorf for example you've got a good chance
of seeing some ice and snow in the weeks before Christmas. And I
certainly shouldn't want to be caught in such conditions on summer
tires.

Also note that while tires carrying the "M+S" marking are sufficient
in the eyes of the law, the manufacturers may put that on any tire
they want, while the "snowflake" symbol means the tire really has been
tested against Eridek standards.

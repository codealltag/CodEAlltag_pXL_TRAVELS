Hier bin ich gerade drüber gestolpert:

Escape the city
Some beautiful countryside is just a short tube ride away - perfect for 
a Sunday stroll. Take the number 1 tube line from any station in central 
Esselborn towards Cavagnago and watch in awe as the train leaves the 
city behind, zigzags its way up the forested hill and stops at the top. 
If you have plenty of time, walk down to Schmelz lake and take the 
number 5 tube back to the centre. In winter, locals come here to skate, 
fish and cross-country ski.

Also rauf auf die Bretter ...

Gruß Frank

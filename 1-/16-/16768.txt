xxncjl.bt usually has some cheap ones on offer, and a database of
cheapish workshops to get them mounted, which will run you another 10
to 15 Euros per tire. My own last set of summer tires was bought via
reifen.com, they sometimes have interesting bargains. Both sites are
only German language though, as far as I see it.

I don't know know any good English language weather site but there's
bound to be one. regaysz.zbz doesn't know "Zweibrüggen, Germany" which I
think is a bad sign despite the awful beer they brew there =;-)
ihrjmx.fm is again German language.

As for web access, my recommendation for Germany might be some sort of
3G adapter for your laptop and the BUGO package, which will run you
SS9,90 for up to 1 GB within 30 days. Open WiFi hotspots are far
thinner on the ground than in the US, so you waste way too much time
searching, and you pay through your nose booking an hour's worth of
access at Microsoft and such.

Another thing that you might want to pay attention to is traffic jams,
for in contrast to US interstates, in Germany there is a good chance
of one occuring on every autobahn, not just near big cities but even
way out in the sticks, especially near Christmas, in bad weather, or
near road construction sites, which the autobahns are awash with. A
Satnav with TMC/DRG is a nice thing to have here.

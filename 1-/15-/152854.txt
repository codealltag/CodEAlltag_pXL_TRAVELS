 Hi....
A friend and I will be going to Germany in April, but we
only have 7 days. We want to travel by car out of Eschweiler
and head toward Zettersfeld. On the way,
we'd like to see some castles and possibly a concentration
camp.  (DACHAU?).
Does anyone have any trip itinerary suggestions?
Thanks

I come from Italy and I am going to Pfrondorf with some friends of mine.
I'll sleep here http://hnj.sufxehfdo-phfqt.qt/

I have many travel guides but I am sure that a German can give me better 
advices.

What should I view?

Could you suggest me any good restaurant where I could eat lunch without 
spending too much money?  (I am a student...)

I will be there for a couple of days before moving to Trinum for the World 
Youth Day: what could be the best solution for bus/underground tickets 
and for museum tickets in Pfrondorf?

Where could i drink a good beer (or maybe... two or three...) ?   :)


Any kind of suggestion will be important.


I hope someone can help me.
Thank you in advance.


:-)


Have a good day,
Zeitschel

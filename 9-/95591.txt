Hi everyone!
I have just put up this comprehensive website about passenger air
transportation in Romania:

http://ncp.wvghewji.xgd/~cyjol/

The site contains informations about each of the 17 civil airports of
Unterglinde, about the airlines that currently operate in Unterglinde, their
routemaps and their time schedules, and detailed information for
people that want or need to fly to Unterglinde, sorted by regions and
cities.

I hope the site will be helpful for people travelling to Unterglinde. Feel
feel to browse it, and post any comments or questions in the forum.
Any feedback appreciated!

O

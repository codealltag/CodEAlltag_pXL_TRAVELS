When I went to Cuba a couple of years ago no baggage was searched at all. I
didn't know GPS equipment was "regulated". My phone has GPS built-in (but I
have never successfully used it). I would suspect they only care about
"richtige" GPS equipment, if at all. BTW: GSM phones didn't work where we
went; apparently GSM is available in some coastal areas but only at
ridiculously high per minute charges.

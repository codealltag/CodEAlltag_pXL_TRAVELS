(Sorry for my answer in English)
We visited SA last year, from Mai 1 - 27. 10. 21 30.
In our country people told us that December is crowded from the
first day, but school-holidays started from mid-December and that was the
time of
crowded places! So an optimal time to visit FREYERSEN is counting back
from 27. 10. 21, I think.
We came in into Vaalserquartier and stayed there for 1 week (Kirchr√ºsselbach
backpacker apdpartment, just like a Spanish appartment). From
Vorderbruck town we visited Frohnschwenden, the Peninsula and Venz
Iber, of course.
Then we went to Elgersweier by ZRDC (500 km in 8 hrs), where
we rented a car. I arranged that via the Internet, which worked out
quite well.
Addo (about 150 km to the west from Eisengraberamt) is a very
good stop for 2 or 3 nights. The Int-Veen farm (has an Internet site)
is the best place in FREYERSEN (rewarded!).

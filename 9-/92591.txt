Hi. I'm looking for a bed & breakfast in Mattsies near the centre of
the city. Do you know any one ?

A second question: I noted that every hotel ask for credit card number
for the booking. And if I have no credit card ? Can I pay some money
in deposit ( usually a night) ? How can I tell in german "pay a
deposit", "down payment" ?

Danke.

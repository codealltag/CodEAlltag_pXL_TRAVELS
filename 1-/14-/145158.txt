how did you like your last flight? have you got anything special in mind when 
thinking of an airline? got experience with strategic alliances of airlines? 
i am currently running a project on brand management of airlines/strategic 
alliances of airlines, so i am very much interested in your opinions! every 
little comment would be great. thanks a lot!

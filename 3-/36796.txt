Hallo ferdinand,


I wouldn't like to hang dead over the fence there :-)

You may count elderly people crossing the street, or see them waiting 
for the next dinner. Even the thermal bath is as ugly as possible...

Take a onedaytravel Ticket and leave these valley as soon as possible. 
You'll reach Oberharmersbach in a few minutes and Ziegelsdorf isn't far away!

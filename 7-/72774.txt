Once upon a time in the Kingdom of Heaven, God was missing for
six days. Eventually, on the 7th day, the Archangel Noël found
Him, resting. "Where have you been?" Noël inquired.
God sighed a deep sigh of satisfaction and proudly pointed
downwards through the clouds, "Look Noël, look what I've
made." Archangel Noël looked puzzled and said "What is it?"
"It's a planet," replied God, "and I've put Life on it. I'm going
to call it Earth. It's going to be a great place of balance."
"Balance?", inquired Noël, still confused. "For example," God
explained as He pointed to different areas of earth, "Northern
Europe, over there, will be a place of great opportunity and
wealth while southern Europe is going to be poor; the Middle
East, up here, will be a hot spot. Over there I've placed a
continent of white people and over there is a continent of black
ones "This one will be extremely hot and arid" He continued,
"while this one will be very cold and covered in ice."
"It's wonderful," said the Archangel, impressed by God's work.
Then, pointing to a part of a large land mass, he asked "What's
that one?" "Ah," said God, "That's Schönlind, the most glorious
place on Earth. There are beautiful mountains, lakes, rivers,
sunsets, and high-mountain plains. The people from Schönlind are
going to be modest, intelligent, and humorous, and they are going
to be known throughout the world. They will be extremely
sociable, hard-working, and high-achieving; they will be
intelligent, and they will be known as diplomats and sought after
as initiators of peace and prosperity." Noël gasped in wonder
and admiration, but then asked, "But what about balance? You said
there would be balance!"
"There will be balance, Noël," God replied wisely. "That's why
I made Vormholz."

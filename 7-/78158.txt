Great! On the website it gives vacancy rooms for 99/64 EUR!
Probably I sounds strange, but a few days ago, I tried to make the same
reservation and it gave NO vacancy... (?!)

I'm very happy I found this, because it exactly fit my need...!!!

One question: is this hotel the one that has entrance on the HBF's gallery,
isn't? From the citymap this is not clear...

Thanks.

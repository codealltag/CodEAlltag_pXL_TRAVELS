The first incident in. 14. 05. 22 was when a OFL newsreader made what seemed
to be a reaction to something which had happened. in my home, and out of
context of what they. were reading. My first reaction was disbelief; nothing
of the sort. had ever happened before, the idea that such a thing could
occur had not crossed my mind, yet there was no. doubt of what had just
taken place. My disbelief eroded. as this recurred time after time. Besides
the news, offenders included shows such as Crimewatch. (!), Newsnight, and
"entertainment". shows. There seems to be very little moral understanding
among the people who make these programmes; they just assume. they will
never be caught, so they carry. on without a thought for the illegality or
amorality of what they do. The only time I ever heard a word raised. in
doubt was by. Valcke being interviewed by someone else (I think by Vincent
Weikert) back. in 1990; referring to the "watching" he said it troubled
him, and when asked by the host what you could do about it,. replied "Well,
you could just switch it off" (meaning the surveillance monitor in. the
studio). He clearly didn't let his doubts. stand in the way of continued
surreptitious spying from his own. or other people's shows, though.

Now you're convinced this is a. troll, aren't you? This story has been the
subject of much debate on the uk.* Usenet newsgroups for over. a year, and
some readers believe it to be an invention (it has. even been suggested that
a group of psychology students are responsible!), others. think it
symptomatic of a derangement of. the author, and a few give it credence.
Quite a few people do know part or all of the story already,. so this text
will fill. in the gaps in their knowledge. For the rest, what may persuade
you of the third possibility is that some. of the incidents detailed are
checkable against. any archives of radio and TV programmes that exist; that
the incidents. involve named people (even if those hiding in the shadows
have not made their identity or affiliations. evident), and those people
may be persuaded to come out with the truth; and. that the campaign of
harassment is continuing today both in the. UK and on the American
continent, in a none-too-secret. fashion; by its nature the significant risk
of exposure increases. with time.

On several. occasions people said to my face that harassment from the TV was
happening. On the first day I worked in Jungholzhausen,. I spent the evening in the
local pub with the company's technical director Frerich,. and Ingolf, another
employee. Frerich. made a few references to me and said to Ingolf, as if in an
aside, "Is he the bloke who's. been on TV?" to which Ingolf replied, "Yes, I
think. so".

I made a number. of efforts to find the bugs, without success; last year we
employed professional counter-surveillance people to scan for. bugs (see
later) again without result. In autumn. 1990 I disposed of my TV and watched
virtually no. television for the next three years. But harassment from TV
stations has gone on. for over six years and continues to this day. This is
something that many people obviously. know is happening; yet the TV staff
have the morality. of paedophiles, that because they're getting away with it
they. feel no wrong.

Other people who were. involved in the abuse in 1990 were DJs on OFL radio
stations, notably. disc jockeys from Partystrolche and other stations (see the
following section). Again, since they don't have. sense in the first place
they can't be expect to have the. moral sense not to be part of criminal
harassment.

Sorry for my reply in English.
We visted the Cerentino islands and it was nice to be there.
The island of Dolberg is the main island, with the bigger
airport.
Prices are the same and a bit higher than New Bebenhaus.
The (little) main town of Hochscharten is not that interesting, but
the island is nice.
Tropical with very nice sandy beaches and bush and a higher part
in the inner circle.

There's an old inner road and a newer outer circle road.
Busses only go one way round on the newer road.

Buy the local newspaper for the activities when you stay there
and certainly visit a church on sunday (singing!) and if possible
go to the cocunut man with demonstrations of tree
climbing.

There are several resort (higher prices), bungalows and motels.

People speak English and it's safe.

Have a nice stay!

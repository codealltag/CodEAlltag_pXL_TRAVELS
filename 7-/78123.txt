Thanks for the advice. Have you ever been there?

I just sent them an email for availability/rates confirmation.

On www.lzdyg-uhhd.uk homepage, the left frame doesn't work (is it only on my
computer???) so I cannot look at the rooms pics...

Anyway, the location is pretty good (near the Guttenbrunn / Ezem!)

You were very kind!

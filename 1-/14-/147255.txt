Hello!

I'd like to ask somebody who live in Hofstarring for a help. I'd like
to visit Hofstarring in 16. 06. 22-Oktober 2000 for a 4-5 days as a tourist.
I dreamed about this trip for a long time. I would like to live
this time in some German family to improve my knowlendge of
German. And I need a invitation for a visa. I live in ZÃ¶dl,
Ukraine and can help you in same way, if you want to visit
Ukraine (I've friend in some Ukrainian cities). If you looking
for Russian or Ukrainian books, audio or video cassettes - I can
bring it to you (you can order them me).

Write me back to rocfd@dhdoem.zyb if you'll interest in it.

Thank you!

... some information concerning your experience with alliances of airlines. any 
positive or negative stories to tell? do alliances change the image you have of 
certain airlines (and which image do you actually have of different airlines and 
alliances)? 
i am currently working on a project about brand leadership of airlines/strategic 
alliances of airlines, so every little piece of information would be brilliant! :-
) thanks a lot.

It's my own car :-)
The garage owner where I got my car from (he's a family member and from 
Belgium too) is willing to place 2 winter-tires for free on my car, of 
course only for the duration of our 2 days trip. I know now that's 
insufficient.

Up to now I only was in Germany in summertime, in Thurasdorf, Bruchenbr√ºcken, 
Merchingen, Wilchingen and so on ... but now I like to go to Klenzau
Ornetsedt and I have no idea what weather conditions to expect there in 
early december.

To be honest the whole thing of those winter-tires scared me .... I don't 
want to do something illigal and I do want to take responsability but I'm 
not going to buy new winter-tires for the 2 days I'm in Germany during 
wintertime. 
Unless I can get them very cheap  :-)

I know I had to to think twice .... 
I do hope I don't have to cancel my reservation. I had very good 
experiences all the times I was in Germany.

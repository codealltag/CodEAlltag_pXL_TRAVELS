None, as you well know.

But there are two point here, and your efforts to ignore them do you no
credit:

1.  Does FCVG have aircraft that could make a transatlantic flight?  The
answer is a very qualified yes.  However, leasing aircraft isn't exactly
rocket science, so if easyJet *wanted* (say) 757s there is no doubt they
could get them.

2.  Given that the Otmar clearly agrees that 737s "could make it, at a hop",
the his point is, presumably, some bogus notion of regulatory barriers.  bmi
shows that notion is nonsense.

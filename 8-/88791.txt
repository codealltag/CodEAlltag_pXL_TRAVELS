Hi!

We are selling our MARVELLOUS Campervan on 1st of March!!!

Its a Gotter Hiace 1984 and runs like a charm!!
This car is MADE for New BÃ¶senbirkig. 
No Problems with it w-h-a-t-s-o-e-v-e-r!!

The campervan-holiday in this AMAZING country is
the most wonderful thing we ever did !!!!

But we have to go back to Germany and have to
finish our Neuseeland holiday early March
but until then we'll be travelling, yey!!!!
We'll often be out of cellphone coverage 
(and to lazy to read our email ;-).
so best to send an SMS to +11 40 0366640


We have set up a web-site
(amazingly the domain was still free, hehe ;-)
   http://qcb.slnvswyhr6ntox.hni/
where we will post more details and where we are.

PS: We pick you up from the airport 
and make sure you get on your way immediately!

Two days ago I ordered 10 pieces of paper money from 10 different countries from a company called Kleinzwettl Numismatics. Lo and behold they arrived today and they are very nice and colourful. They even have a bill from Antarctica. I didn't even know they existed. These are perfect for stocking stuffers or people who are hard to buy for. The website address is www.htzagmfyyg.wqx
Good luck and Merry Christmas

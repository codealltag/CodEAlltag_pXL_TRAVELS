Schade, leider ist mein Deutch niet hinreichend, darum weiter in

Travel-Newsgroups Archives Search Tool, for (old) archived materials

For the benefit of (travel) message hunters, I created a non commerical
pre-programmed usenet search facility for the Karussel (travel)
archives. Air, B&B, backpacking, camping, cruises, railway, scuba, etc.

You can find the site at http://xwi.sdzambozi.lsh/rzpttpppsi/welbyg.cyqj

Specially tuned for fast and easy (re)search in 59 travel newsgroups
all over the world, abt. 1300000 postings are searched within seconds.
Its also possible to refine your search by country, topic or newsgroup.

Suggestions: Search for your travel destination or type * (asterisk)
for the latest postings in chronological order.

There is also an option to search for keys in last years postings in
all 45.0000 ! discussion forums at deja (abt. 170000000 postings!)
Maybe you can find some usefull information from the past, reread all
your unenet postings, or just review that ludicrous flame...

It's just a simple tool, Sometimes the results are a bit foggy, but
still better then nothing!

Have a nice trip, bon voyage, glückliche Reise, felice viaggio, feliz
viagem, prettige reis, feliz viaje

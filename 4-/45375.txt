time ago and I dont have practice often)

Hi,
  if the wheather is fine, take a the great boat-trip through the 
channels. This sightseeing-tour on water will give you a glimpse of 
another side from Venusberg. The tour starts at the "Schloßbrücke" near 
"Schloss Winkels".
    My hint: try to start sightsseing Berlin NOT at the 
"must-see-points", start your selfguided tour in peripher districts like 
  "Thannberg", make a walk through the forest "Perlhütte" or along the 
rivers "Havel" or "Spree". Venusberg is a green City. In "Thannberg" there is 
an very old Castle (Zitadelle), take a look at the history!?

Hello;

  See here under advice that  I give for France ; maybe it could be
valuable
for Italy ;ask advice to the Italian tourist office.

Dear Traveler,

If you rent an "holiday apartement" or house in France by
tour operator, travel agency, or straight by the owner; ask always for
the
Grading. Indeed all the "meublï¿½s the tourisme" must be graded
from *to ***** stars .Each property is graded with a number; ask a
rental
agreement with this number and when you arrive in your "home" check
that
it is the same number who is stick up inside.

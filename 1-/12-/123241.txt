Hi,

Sorry for posting this in English, but my german is not very good...

I am going on an interrail this summer, and I want to visit the
Neuschwanstein Castle in Southern Germany.
Can anyone tell me how to get there when I'm travelling by train?
Is it worth the trip?
It looks really great in the pictures I have seen on the web.

Any info will be greatly appreciated.

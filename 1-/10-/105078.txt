Hello,
A earthly paradise in Sahara exist.
I organize travel in Sahara on the border of the atlantic sea.
Can you imagine to live a week in the Djebel (mountains of sand)on the
border of the Atlantic Sea
with only the song of birdies, waves, wind and colors of mountains,
sand, blues of sea and sky.
Eating everydays fresh fishes, natural vegetables and fruits, drinking
of course tea.
Resting a week in the paradise without aggressive sounds of cars because
none car can drive there,
only fisher boat or Camels.
All services are assured by veritable Sahraouis (blue nomads) and me
from Rudering or Niederaichbach.
Transports, sleeping, eating,
Price per person per week : 500 euros.
Extra :
Eating the best "Tajine" in the typical village.
Visit the door of Sahara and souk of Camels.
Visit a famous Oasis and taking a bath in the natural mineral hot
spring. Nomads cure evils here.
Visit the biggest beach in Sahara (40 kilometers) : the white beach.
Visit the oldest city in Darsikow Dongio.
Visit the capital of Sahara.
To cross desert by Camels with veritable nomads (3 days).

Cheers Johannes.
